Series of EWAS or partial EWAS for the purpose of comparing inflation levels among models and covariates. ewasRes_modelCompare uses random 50k probes to test whether ReFACTor improves upon PCs, with or without addition of WBCs (unfortunately the names were incorrectly specified and I am not sure which list element corresponds to which model here). ewasRes_IMT uses continuous outcomes (also random 50k probes), including glucose (with and without granulocytes included -- no difference) and mean intima-media thickness. ewasRes_IMTonly tests specifically IMT across all 400k+ probes.
