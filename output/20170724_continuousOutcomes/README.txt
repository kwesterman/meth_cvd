I explored the creation of methylation risk scores from quantitative/continuous outcomes -- Framingham Risk Score and mean intima-media thickness -- as alternatives to directly using CVD outcomes. An initial script created these MRS using the entire population (saved in mrsDat_penalized.RData), and another script used 3-fold CV to examine their performance in predicting CVD incidence compared to directly training on CVD events. nonMethData2.RData contains the basic nonMethData dataset with the addition of "IMT_mean" as a covariate, which was calculated manually/interactively from FHS data.
