\section{Supplemental Methods}\label{supplemental-methods}}

\hypertarget{womens-health-initiative}{%
\subsection{Women's Health Initiative}\label{womens-health-initiative}}

WHI methylation data came from the BA23 ancillary study, a combined
case-control and pseudo case-cohort sampling of 2129 women from the
Women's Health Initiative study. WHI is a larger prospective cohort
beginning in 1993 that included over 160,000 postmenopausal women from
across the United States\textsuperscript{45}. Included subjects had no
self-reported CVD at baseline, and cases were chosen based on incident
centrally adjudicated angina, revascularization, or CHD event during
follow-up. Inclusion criteria for methylation measurement resulted in an
oversampling of African American and Hispanic participants. Blood
samples used for measurement of DNA methylation and clinical
biochemistry were taken at baseline. Data are available in the dbGaP
public repository (accession: phs000200.v11.p3; downloaded on September
27, 2017).

\hypertarget{framingham-heart-study-offspring-cohort}{%
\subsection{Framingham Heart Study Offspring
Cohort}\label{framingham-heart-study-offspring-cohort}}

FHS methylation data came from a substudy of the Framingham Heart Study
that measured DNA methylation in 2726 subjects from the Offspring
Cohort. The Framingham Offspring Cohort was originally established in
1971 to follow 5209 children of the original Framingham Heart Study
participants and their spouses\textsuperscript{46}. Fasting blood samples
for both methylation and clinical biochemistry were collected from
participants at Exam 8, which took place from 2005-8. Blood samples were
also provided for clinical biochemistry measurements in previous exams,
constituting the ``past exposures'' examined here. Data are available in
the dbGaP public repository (accession: phs000007.v29.p10; downloaded on
September 27, 2017). Adjudicated cardiovascular event data was collected
through 2015, and events were defined here as any of: myocardial
infarction, angina pectoris, stroke (approximately 90\% being ischemic),
or death from CHD (Framingham event codes 1-29). FHS methylation data
were collected in two primary batches in two centers -- one in subjects
from a nested case-control for CVD measured at Johns Hopkins University
(FHS-JHU)\textsuperscript{47}, and the other in a larger set of
remaining Framingham Offspring participants measured at the University
of Minnesota (FHS-UM).

\hypertarget{lothian-birth-cohorts}{%
\subsection{Lothian Birth Cohorts}\label{lothian-birth-cohorts}}

The Lothian Birth Cohorts consist of two birth cohorts (born in 1921 and
1936) established in the Lothian region of Scotland\textsuperscript{48,49}. Only the 1936 cohort was analyzed here. Blood samples
were collected in three waves starting in 2004, with our primary
analyses here focusing on samples from Wave 1 (2004-2007).
Cardiovascular outcomes were defined as general CVD or stroke determined
at each wave, and event times for survival models were approximated
based on the time between Wave 1 and the wave at which the event was
reported. LBC data are accessible through the European Genome-phenome
Archive (accession: EGAD00010000604).

\hypertarget{regicor}{%
\subsection{REGICOR}\label{regicor}}

The REGICOR dataset analyzed here consisted of a nested case-control for
myocardial infarction within the larger REGICOR (REgistre GIron√≠ del
COR) cohort from the Girona Province in Catalonia (Spain). Whole blood
samples were collected from 391 total participants, with those from
cases generally collected within 24 hours of the event. Characteristics
for this population are available in Supp. Table S3.
