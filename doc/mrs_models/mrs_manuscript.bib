abstract = {Aging associates with impaired pancreatic islet function and increased type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in $\beta$-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epigenetic features such as DNA hypomethylation have been associated with conditions related to cardiovascular risk. We evaluated whether lower blood DNA methylation in heavily methylated repetitive sequences predicts the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke. METHODS: We quantified blood DNA methylation of Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element-1 (LINE-1) repetitive elements through PCR-pyrosequencing in 712 elderly individuals from the Boston-area Normative Aging Study. We estimated risk-factor adjusted relative risks (RRs) for ischemic heart disease and stroke at baseline (242 prevalent cases), and during follow-up (44 new cases; median follow-up, 63 months), as well as subsequent mortality from ischemic heart disease (86 deaths; median follow-up, 75 months). RESULTS: Blood LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with baseline ischemic heart disease (RR = 2.1 [95{\%} confidence interval = 1.2-4.0] for lowest vs. highest methylation quartile) and for stroke (2.5 [0.9-7.5]). Among participants free of baseline disease, individuals with methylation below the median also had higher risk of developing ischemic heart disease (4.0 [1.8-8.9]) or stroke (5.7 [0.8-39.5]). In the entire cohort, persons with methylation below the median had higher mortality from ischemic heart disease (3.3 [1.3-8.4]) and stroke (2.8 [0.6-14.3]). Total mortality was also increased (2.0 [1.2-3.3]). These results were confirmed in additional regression models using LINE-1 methylation as a continuous variable. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with prevalent IHD and stroke exhibited lower LINE-1 methylation. In longitudinal analyses, persons with lower LINE-1 methylation were at higher risk for incident ischemic heart disease and stroke, and for total mortality.},

abstract = {Background and aims The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the association between DNA methylation and coronary heart disease (CHD) or related atherosclerotic traits. Methods A systematic review was designed. The condition of interest was DNA methylation, and the outcome was CHD or other atherosclerosis-related traits. Three DNA methylation approaches were considered: global methylation, candidate-gene, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). A functional analysis was undertaken using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Results In total, 51 articles were included in the analysis: 12 global methylation, 34 candidate-gene and 11 EWAS, with six studies using more than one approach. The results of the global methylation studies were inconsistent. The candidate-gene results were consistent for some genes, suggesting that hypermethylation in ESR$\alpha$, ABCG1 and FOXP3 and hypomethylation in IL-6 were associated with CHD. The EWAS identified 84 genes showing differential methylation associated with CHD in more than one study. The probability of these findings was {\textless}1.37{\textperiodcentered}10âˆ’5. One third of these genes have been related to obesity in genome-wide association studies. The functional analysis identified several diseases and functions related to these set of genes: inflammatory, metabolic and cardiovascular disease. Conclusions Global DNA methylation seems to be not associated with CHD. The evidence from candidate-gene studies was limited. The EWAS identified a set of 84 genes highlighting the relevance of obesity, inflammation, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in CHD. This set of genes could be prioritized in future studies assessing the role of DNA methylation in CHD.},

abstract = {Although it is assumed that epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), underlie the relationship between adverse intrauterine conditions and adult metabolic health, evidence from human studies remains scarce. Therefore, we evaluated whether DNAm in whole blood mediated the association between prenatal famine exposure and metabolic health in 422 individuals exposed to famine in utero and 463 (sibling) controls. We implemented a two-step analysis, namely, a genome-wide exploration across 342,596 cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) for potential mediators of the association between prenatal famine exposure and adult body mass index (BMI), serum triglycerides (TG), or glucose concentrations, which was followed by formal mediation analysis. DNAm mediated the association of prenatal famine exposure with adult BMI and TG but not with glucose. DNAm at PIM3 (cg09349128), a gene involved in energy metabolism, mediated 13.4{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 5 to 28{\%}] of the association between famine exposure and BMI. DNAm at six CpGs, including TXNIP (cg19693031), influencing $\beta$ cell function, and ABCG1 (cg07397296), affecting lipid metabolism, together mediated 80{\%} (95{\%} CI, 38.5 to 100{\%}) of the association between famine exposure and TG. Analyses restricted to those exposed to famine during early gestation identified additional CpGs mediating the relationship with TG near PFKFB3 (glycolysis) and METTL8 (adipogenesis). DNAm at the CpGs involved was associated with gene expression in an external data set and correlated with DNAm levels in fat depots in additional postmortem data. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms mediate the influence of transient adverse environmental factors in early life on long-term metabolic health. The specific mechanism awaits elucidation.},

abstract = {The ability to identify a specific cancer using minimally invasive biopsy holds great promise for improving the diagnosis, treatment selection, and prediction of prognosis in cancer. Using whole-genome methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and machine learning methods, we evaluated the utility of DNA methylation for differentiating tumor tissue and normal tissue for four common cancers (breast, colon, liver, and lung). We identified cancer markers in a training cohort of 1,619 tumor samples and 173 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. We replicated our findings in a separate TCGA cohort of 791 tumor samples and 93 matched adjacent normal tissue samples, as well as an independent Chinese cohort of 394 tumor samples and 324 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. The DNA methylation analysis could predict cancer versus normal tissue with more than 95{\%} accuracy in these three cohorts, demonstrating accuracy comparable to typical diagnostic methods. This analysis also correctly identified 29 of 30 colorectal cancer metastases to the liver and 32 of 34 colorectal cancer metastases to the lung. We also found that methylation patterns can predict prognosis and survival. We correlated differential methylation of CpG sites predictive of cancer with expression of associated genes known to be important in cancer biology, showing decreased expression with increased methylation, as expected. We verified gene expression profiles in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the utility of methylation biomarkers for the molecular characterization of cancer, with implications for diagnosis and prognosis.},

Because most common diseases have a genetic component, one important approach is to stratify individuals based on inherited DNA variation1. Proposed clinical applications have largely focused on finding carriers of rare monogenic mutations at several-fold increased risk. Although most disease risk is polygenic in nature2â€“5, it has not yet been possible to use polygenic predictors to identify individuals at risk comparable to monogenic mutations. Here, we develop and validate genome-wide polygenic scores for five common diseases. The approach identifies 8.0, 6.1, 3.5, 3.2, and 1.5{\%} of the population at greater than threefold increased risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer, respectively. For coronary artery disease, this prevalence is 20-fold higher than the carrier frequency of rare monogenic mutations conferring comparable risk6. We propose that it is time to contemplate the inclusion of polygenic risk prediction in clinical care, and discuss relevant issues.},

A deeper understanding of TNF-$\alpha$ biology may enhance treatment precision. Objective To conduct an epigenome-wide analysis of blood-derived DNA methylation and TNF-$\alpha$ levels and to assess the clinical relevance of findings. Design, Setting, and Participants This meta-analysis assessed epigenome-wide associations in circulating TNF-$\alpha$ concentrations from 5 cohort studies and 1 interventional trial, with replication in 3 additional cohort studies. Follow-up analyses investigated associations of identified methylation loci with gene expression and incident coronary heart disease; this meta-analysis included 11 461 participants who experienced 1895 coronary events. Exposures Circulating TNF-$\alpha$ concentration. Main Outcomes and Measures DNA methylation at approximately 450 000 loci, neighboring DNA sequence variation, gene expression, and incident coronary heart disease. Results The discovery cohort included 4794 participants, and the replication study included 816 participants (overall mean [SD] age, 60.7 [8.5] years).

abstract = {The extent to which genetic influences on cardiovascular disease risk are mediated by changes in DNA methylation levels has not been systematically explored. We developed an analytical framework that integrates genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization with epigenome-wide association studies to evaluate the causal relationships between methylation levels and 14 cardiovascular disease traits. We identified ten genetic loci known to influence proximal DNA methylation which were also associated with cardiovascular traits after multiple-testing correction. Bivariate fine mapping provided evidence that the individual variants responsible for the observed effects on cardiovascular traits at the ADCY3 and ADIPOQ loci were potentially mediated through changes in DNA methylation, although we highlight that we are unable to reliably separate causality from horizontal pleiotropy. Estimates of causal effects were replicated with results from large-scale consortia. Genetic variants and CpG sites identified in this study were enriched for histone mark peaks in relevant tissue types and gene promoter regions. Integrating our results with expression quantitative trait loci data, we provide evidence that variation at these regulatory regions is likely to also influence gene expression levels at these loci.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiles are responsive to environmental stimuli and metabolic shifts. This makes DNA methylation a potential biomarker of environmental-related and lifestyle-driven diseases of adulthood. Therefore, we investigated if white blood cells' (WBCs) DNA methylation profiles are associated with myocardial infarction (MI) occurrence. Whole-genome DNA methylation was investigated by microarray analysis in 292 MI cases and 292 matched controls from the large prospective Italian European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (EPICOR study). Significant signals (false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P {\textless} 0.05) were replicated by mass spectrometry in 317 MI cases and 262 controls from the Dutch EPIC cohort (EPIC-NL). Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) methylation profiles were also evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: A differentially methylated region (DMR) within the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 12 (ZBTB12) gene body and LINE-1 hypomethylation were identified in EPICOR MI cases and replicated in the EPIC-NL sample (ZBTB12-DMR meta-analysis: effect size Â± se = -0.016 Â± 0.003, 95 {\%} CI = -0.021;-0.011, P = 7.54 Ã— 10(-10); LINE-1 methylation meta-analysis: effect size Â± se = -0.161 Â± 0.040, 95 {\%} CI = -0.239;-0.082, P = 6.01 Ã— 10(-5)). Moreover, cases with shorter time to disease had more pronounced ZBTB12-DMR hypomethylation (meta-analysis, men: effect size Â± se = -0.0059 Â± 0.0017, P TREND = 5.0 Ã— 10(-4); women: effect size Â± se = -0.0053 Â± 0.0019, P TREND = 6.5 Ã— 10(-3)) and LINE-1 hypomethylation (meta-analysis, men: effect size Â± se = -0.0010 Â± 0.0003, P TREND = 1.6 Ã— 10(-3); women: effect size Â± se = -0.0008 Â± 0.0004, P TREND = 0.026) than MI cases with longer time to disease. In the EPIC-NL replication panel, DNA methylation profiles improved case-control discrimination and reclassification when compared with traditional MI risk factors only (net reclassification improvement (95 {\%} CI) between 0.23 (0.02-0.43), P = 0.034, and 0.89 (0.64-1.14), P {\textless} 1 Ã— 10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that specific methylation profiles can be detected in WBCs, in a preclinical condition, several years before the occurrence of MI, providing an independent signature of cardiovascular risk. We showed that prediction accuracy can be improved when DNA methylation is taken into account together with traditional MI risk factors, although further confirmation on a larger sample is warranted. Our findings support the potential use of DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood white cells as promising early biomarkers of MI.},
