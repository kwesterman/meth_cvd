abstract = {It was unknown whether plasma protein levels can be estimated based on DNA methylation (DNAm) levels, and if so, how the resulting surrogates can be consolidated into a powerful predictor of lifespan. We present here, seven DNAm-based estimators of plasma proteins including those of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and growth differentiation factor 15. The resulting predictor of lifespan, DNAm GrimAge (in units of years), is a composite biomarker based on the seven DNAm surrogates and a DNAm-based estimator of smoking pack-years. Adjusting DNAm GrimAge for chronological age generated novel measure of epigenetic age acceleration, AgeAccelGrim.Using large scale validation data from thousands of individuals, we demonstrate that DNAm GrimAge stands out among existing epigenetic clocks in terms of its predictive ability for time-to-death (Cox regression P=2.0E-75), time-to-coronary heart disease (Cox P=6.2E-24), time-to-cancer (P= 1.3E-12), its strong relationship with computed tomography data for fatty liver/excess visceral fat, and age-at-menopause (P=1.6E-12). AgeAccelGrim is strongly associated with a host of age-related conditions including comorbidity count (P=3.45E-17). Similarly, age-adjusted DNAm PAI-1 levels are associated with lifespan (P=5.4E-28), comorbidity count (P= 7.3E-56) and type 2 diabetes (P=2.0E-26). These DNAm-based biomarkers show the expected relationship with lifestyle factors including healthy diet and educational attainment.Overall, these epigenetic biomarkers are expected to find many applications including human anti-aging studies.},

abstract = {A key public health need is to identify individuals at high risk for a given disease to enable enhanced screening or preventive therapies. Because most common diseases have a genetic component, one important approach is to stratify individuals based on inherited DNA variation1. Proposed clinical applications have largely focused on finding carriers of rare monogenic mutations at several-fold increased risk. Although most disease risk is polygenic in nature2–5, it has not yet been possible to use polygenic predictors to identify individuals at risk comparable to monogenic mutations. Here, we develop and validate genome-wide polygenic scores for five common diseases. The approach identifies 8.0, 6.1, 3.5, 3.2, and 1.5{\%} of the population at greater than threefold increased risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer, respectively. For coronary artery disease, this prevalence is 20-fold higher than the carrier frequency of rare monogenic mutations conferring comparable risk6. We propose that it is time to contemplate the inclusion of polygenic risk prediction in clinical care, and discuss relevant issues.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the most stable and experimentally accessible epigenetic mark, DNA methylation is of great interest to the research community. The landscape of DNA methylation across tissues, through development and in disease pathogenesis is not yet well characterized. Thus there is a need for rapid and cost effective methods for assessing genome-wide levels of DNA methylation. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip is a very useful addition to the available methods for DNA methylation analysis but its complex design, incorporating two different assay methods, requires careful consideration. Accordingly, several normalization schemes have been published. We have taken advantage of known DNA methylation patterns associated with genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in addition to the performance of SNP genotyping assays present on the array, to derive three independent metrics which we use to test alternative schemes of correction and normalization. These metrics also have potential utility as quality scores for datasets.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The standard index of DNA methylation at any specific CpG site is $\beta$ = M/(M + U + 100) where M and U are methylated and unmethylated signal intensities, respectively. Betas ($\beta$s) calculated from raw signal intensities (the default GenomeStudio behavior) perform well, but using 11 methylomic datasets we demonstrate that quantile normalization methods produce marked improvement, even in highly consistent data, by all three metrics. The commonly used procedure of normalizing betas is inferior to the separate normalization of M and U, and it is also advantageous to normalize Type I and Type II assays separately. More elaborate manipulation of quantiles proves to be counterproductive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Careful selection of preprocessing steps can minimize variance and thus improve statistical power, especially for the detection of the small absolute DNA methylation changes likely associated with complex disease phenotypes. For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called wateRmelon, downloadable from bioConductor, compatible with the existing methylumi, minfi and IMA packages, that allows others to utilize the same normalization methods and data quality tests on 450K data.},

abstract = {Motivation: The Illumina Infinium 450 k DNA Methylation Beadchip is a prime candidate technology for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely differ-ent DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs. Results: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normal-ization strategy for 450 k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a stat-istical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favour-ably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes. BMIQ will be useful as a preprocessing step for any study using the Illumina Infinium 450 k platform.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 27k Illumina Infinium Methylation Beadchip is a popular high-throughput technology that allows the methylation state of over 27,000 CpGs to be assayed. While feature selection and classification methods have been comprehensively explored in the context of gene expression data, relatively little is known as to how best to perform feature selection or classification in the context of Illumina Infinium methylation data. Given the rising importance of epigenomics in cancer and other complex genetic diseases, and in view of the upcoming epigenome wide association studies, it is critical to identify the statistical methods that offer improved inference in this novel context. RESULTS: Using a total of 7 large Illumina Infinium 27k Methylation data sets, encompassing over 1,000 samples from a wide range of tissues, we here provide an evaluation of popular feature selection, dimensional reduction and classification methods on DNA methylation data. Specifically, we evaluate the effects of variance filtering, supervised principal components (SPCA) and the choice of DNA methylation quantification measure on downstream statistical inference. We show that for relatively large sample sizes feature selection using test statistics is similar for M and beta-values, but that in the limit of small sample sizes, M-values allow more reliable identification of true positives. We also show that the effect of variance filtering on feature selection is study-specific and dependent on the phenotype of interest and tissue type profiled. Specifically, we find that variance filtering improves the detection of true positives in studies with large effect sizes, but that it may lead to worse performance in studies with smaller yet significant effect sizes. In contrast, supervised principal components improves the statistical power, especially in studies with small effect sizes. We also demonstrate that classification using the Elastic Net and Support Vector Machine (SVM) clearly outperforms competing methods like LASSO and SPCA. Finally, in unsupervised modelling of cancer diagnosis, we find that non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) clearly outperforms principal components analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of tailoring the feature selection and classification methodology to the sample size and biological context of the DNA methylation study. The Elastic Net emerges as a powerful classification algorithm for large-scale DNA methylation studies, while NMF does well in the unsupervised context. The insights presented here will be useful to any study embarking on large-scale DNA methylation profiling using Illumina Infinium beadarrays.},

abstract = {The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a large and complex clinical investigation of strategies for the prevention and control of some of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among postmenopausal women, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporotic fractures. The WHI was initiated in 1992, with a planned completion date of 2007. Postmenopausal women ranging in age from 50 to 79 are enrolled at one of 40 WHI clinical centers nationwide into either a clinical trial (CT) that will include about 64,500 women or an observational study (OS) that will include about 100,000 women. The CT is designed to allow randomized controlled evaluation of three distinct interventions: a low-fat eating pattern, hypothesized to prevent breast cancer and colorectal cancer and, secondarily, coronary heart disease; hormone replacement therapy, hypothesized to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases and, secondarily, to reduce the risk of hip and other fractures, with increased breast cancer risk as a possible adverse outcome; and calcium and vitamin D supplementation, hypothesized to prevent hip fractures and, secondarily, other fractures and colorectal cancer. Overall benefit-versus-risk assessment is a central focus in each of the three CT components. Women are screened for participation in one or both of the components—dietary modification (DM) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)—of the CT, which will randomize 48,000 and 27,500 women, respectively. Women who prove to be ineligible for, or who are unwilling to enroll in, these CT components are invited to enroll in the OS. At their 1-year anniversary of randomization, CT women are invited to be further randomized into the calcium and vitamin D (CaD) trial component, which is projected to include 45,000 women. The average follow-up for women in either CT or OS is approximately 9 years. Concerted efforts are made to enroll women of racial and ethnic minority groups, with a target of 20{\%} of overall enrollment in both the CT and OS. This article gives a brief description of the rationale for the interventions being studied in each of the CT components and for the inclusion of the OS component. Some detail is provided on specific study design choices, including eligibility criteria, recruitment strategy, and sample size, with attention to the partial factorial design of the CT. Some aspects of the CT monitoring approach are also outlined. The scientific and logistic complexity of the WHI implies particular leadership and management challenges. The WHI organization and committee structure employed to respond to these challenges is also briefly described.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epigenetic features such as DNA hypomethylation have been associated with conditions related to cardiovascular risk. We evaluated whether lower blood DNA methylation in heavily methylated repetitive sequences predicts the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke. METHODS: We quantified blood DNA methylation of Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element-1 (LINE-1) repetitive elements through PCR-pyrosequencing in 712 elderly individuals from the Boston-area Normative Aging Study. We estimated risk-factor adjusted relative risks (RRs) for ischemic heart disease and stroke at baseline (242 prevalent cases), and during follow-up (44 new cases; median follow-up, 63 months), as well as subsequent mortality from ischemic heart disease (86 deaths; median follow-up, 75 months). RESULTS: Blood LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with baseline ischemic heart disease (RR = 2.1 [95{\%} confidence interval = 1.2-4.0] for lowest vs. highest methylation quartile) and for stroke (2.5 [0.9-7.5]). Among participants free of baseline disease, individuals with methylation below the median also had higher risk of developing ischemic heart disease (4.0 [1.8-8.9]) or stroke (5.7 [0.8-39.5]). In the entire cohort, persons with methylation below the median had higher mortality from ischemic heart disease (3.3 [1.3-8.4]) and stroke (2.8 [0.6-14.3]). Total mortality was also increased (2.0 [1.2-3.3]). These results were confirmed in additional regression models using LINE-1 methylation as a continuous variable. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with prevalent IHD and stroke exhibited lower LINE-1 methylation. In longitudinal analyses, persons with lower LINE-1 methylation were at higher risk for incident ischemic heart disease and stroke, and for total mortality.},

Using whole-genome methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and machine learning methods, we evaluated the utility of DNA methylation for differentiating tumor tissue and normal tissue for four common cancers (breast, colon, liver, and lung). We identified cancer markers in a training cohort of 1,619 tumor samples and 173 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. We replicated our findings in a separate TCGA cohort of 791 tumor samples and 93 matched adjacent normal tissue samples, as well as an independent Chinese cohort of 394 tumor samples and 324 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. The DNA methylation analysis could predict cancer versus normal tissue with more than 95{\%} accuracy in these three cohorts, demonstrating accuracy comparable to typical diagnostic methods. This analysis also correctly identified 29 of 30 colorectal cancer metastases to the liver and 32 of 34 colorectal cancer metastases to the lung. We also found that methylation patterns can predict prognosis and survival. We correlated differential methylation of CpG sites predictive of cancer with expression of associated genes known to be important in cancer biology, showing decreased expression with increased methylation, as expected. We verified gene expression profiles in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the utility of methylation biomarkers for the molecular characterization of cancer, with implications for diagnosis and prognosis.},

abstract = {Multiple epigenome-wide association studies have been performed to identify DNA methylation patterns regulated by aging or correlated with risk of death. However, the inter-relatedness of the epigenetic basis of aging and mortality has not been well investigated. Using genome-wide DNA methylation data from the Lothian Birth Cohorts, we conducted a genome-wide association analysis of all-cause mortality and compared this with age-associated methylation patterns reported on the same samples. Survival analysis using the Cox regression model identified 2552 CpG sites with genome-wide significance (false discovery rate {\textless} 0.05) for all-cause mortality. CpGs whose methylation levels are associated with increased mortality appear more distributed from the gene body to the intergenic regions whereas CpGs whose methylation levels are associated with decreased mortality is more concentrated at the promoter regions. In comparison with reported CpGs displaying significant age-dependent methylation patterns in the same samples, we observed a limited but highly significant overlap between mortality-associated and age-associated CpGs (p value 2.52e−06). Most importantly, the overlapping CpGs are dominated by those whose overall age-related methylation patterns reduce the risk of death. All-cause mortality is significantly associated with altered methylation at multiple genomic sites with differential distribution in gene regions for CpGs correlated with increased or decreased risk of death. The age-dependent methylation changes could reflect an active response to the aging process that contributes to maintain individual survival.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiles are responsive to environmental stimuli and metabolic shifts. This makes DNA methylation a potential biomarker of environmental-related and lifestyle-driven diseases of adulthood. Therefore, we investigated if white blood cells' (WBCs) DNA methylation profiles are associated with myocardial infarction (MI) occurrence. Whole-genome DNA methylation was investigated by microarray analysis in 292 MI cases and 292 matched controls from the large prospective Italian European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (EPICOR study). Significant signals (false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P {\textless} 0.05) were replicated by mass spectrometry in 317 MI cases and 262 controls from the Dutch EPIC cohort (EPIC-NL). Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) methylation profiles were also evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: A differentially methylated region (DMR) within the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 12 (ZBTB12) gene body and LINE-1 hypomethylation were identified in EPICOR MI cases and replicated in the EPIC-NL sample (ZBTB12-DMR meta-analysis: effect size ± se = -0.016 ± 0.003, 95 {\%} CI = -0.021;-0.011, P = 7.54 × 10(-10); LINE-1 methylation meta-analysis: effect size ± se = -0.161 ± 0.040, 95 {\%} CI = -0.239;-0.082, P = 6.01 × 10(-5)). Moreover, cases with shorter time to disease had more pronounced ZBTB12-DMR hypomethylation (meta-analysis, men: effect size ± se = -0.0059 ± 0.0017, P TREND = 5.0 × 10(-4); women: effect size ± se = -0.0053 ± 0.0019, P TREND = 6.5 × 10(-3)) and LINE-1 hypomethylation (meta-analysis, men: effect size ± se = -0.0010 ± 0.0003, P TREND = 1.6 × 10(-3); women: effect size ± se = -0.0008 ± 0.0004, P TREND = 0.026) than MI cases with longer time to disease. In the EPIC-NL replication panel, DNA methylation profiles improved case-control discrimination and reclassification when compared with traditional MI risk factors only (net reclassification improvement (95 {\%} CI) between 0.23 (0.02-0.43), P = 0.034, and 0.89 (0.64-1.14), P {\textless} 1 × 10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that specific methylation profiles can be detected in WBCs, in a preclinical condition, several years before the occurrence of MI, providing an independent signature of cardiovascular risk. We showed that prediction accuracy can be improved when DNA methylation is taken into account together with traditional MI risk factors, although further confirmation on a larger sample is warranted. Our findings support the potential use of DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood white cells as promising early biomarkers of MI.},

While the first generation of epigenetic biomarkers of aging were developed using chronological age as a surrogate for biological age, we hypothesized that incorporation of composite clinical measures of phenotypic age that capture differences in lifespan and healthspan may identify novel CpGs and facilitate the development of a more powerful epigenetic biomarker of aging. Using an innovative two-step process, we develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions for a variety of aging outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cancers, healthspan, physical functioning, and Alzheimer's disease. While this biomarker was developed using data from whole blood, it correlates strongly with age in every tissue and cell tested. Based on an in-depth transcriptional analysis in sorted cells, we find that increased epigenetic, relative to chronological age, is associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage response, and mitochondrial signatures. Overall, this single epigenetic biomarker of aging is able to capture risks for an array of diverse outcomes across multiple tissues and cells, and provide insight into important pathways in aging.},

The ability to determine genome-wide methylation patterns will rapidly advance methylation research.},

This may reflect a reduced systemic remethylation capacity, which would be expected to cause decreased genomic DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the association between prevalence of CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke) and its predisposing conditions (hypertension, diabetes) and PBL global genomic DNA methylation as represented by ALU and Satellite 2 (AS) repetitive element DNA methylation in 286 participants of the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a population-based prospective investigation of 63,257 men and women aged 45-74 years recruited during 1993-1998. Men exhibited significantly higher global DNA methylation [geometric mean (95{\%} confidence interval (CI)): 159 (143, 178)] than women [133 (121, 147)] (P = 0.01). Global DNA methylation was significantly elevated in men with a history of CVD or its predisposing conditions at baseline (P = 0.03) but not in women (P = 0.53). Fifty-two subjects (22 men, 30 women) who were negative for these CVD/predisposing conditions at baseline acquired one or more of these conditions by the time of their follow-up I interviews, which took place on average about 5.8 years post-enrollment. Global DNA methylation levels of the 22 incident cases in men were intermediate (AS, 177) relative to the 56 male subjects who remained free of CVD/predisposing conditions at follow-up (lowest AS, 132) and the 51 male subjects with a diagnosis of CVD or predisposing conditions reported at baseline (highest AS 184) (P for trend = 0.0008) No such association was observed in women (P = 0.91). Baseline body mass index was positively associated with AS in both men and women (P = 0.007).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that elevated, not decreased, PBL DNA methylation is positively associated with prevalence of CVD/predisposing conditions and obesity in Singapore Chinese.},

abstract = {Aging associates with impaired pancreatic islet function and increased type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in $\beta$-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a long-standing need in biomedical research for a method that quantifies the normally mixed composition of leukocytes beyond what is possible by simple histological or flow cytometric assessments. The latter is restricted by the labile nature of protein epitopes, requirements for cell processing, and timely cell analysis. In a diverse array of diseases and following numerous immune-toxic exposures, leukocyte composition will critically inform the underlying immuno-biology to most chronic medical conditions. Emerging research demonstrates that DNA methylation is responsible for cellular differentiation, and when measured in whole peripheral blood, serves to distinguish cancer cases from controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present a method, similar to regression calibration, for inferring changes in the distribution of white blood cells between different subpopulations (e.g. cases and controls) using DNA methylation signatures, in combination with a previously obtained external validation set consisting of signatures from purified leukocyte samples. We validate the fundamental idea in a cell mixture reconstruction experiment, then demonstrate our method on DNA methylation data sets from several studies, including data from a Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) study and an ovarian cancer study. Our method produces results consistent with prior biological findings, thereby validating the approach.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our method, in combination with an appropriate external validation set, promises new opportunities for large-scale immunological studies of both disease states and noxious exposures.},

abstract = {The ability to measure human aging from molecular profiles has practical implications in many fields, including disease prevention and treatment, forensics, and extension of life. Although chronological age has been linked to changes in DNA methylation, the methylome has not yet been used to measure and compare human aging rates. Here, we build a quantitative model of aging using measurements at more than 450,000 CpG markers from the whole blood of 656 human individuals, aged 19 to 101. This model measures the rate at which an individual's methylome ages, which we show is impacted by gender and genetic variants. We also show that differences in aging rates help explain epigenetic drift and are reflected in the transcriptome. Moreover, we show how our aging model is upheld in other human tissues and reveals an advanced aging rate in tumor tissue. Our model highlights specific components of the aging process and provides a quantitative readout for studying the role of methylation in age-related disease. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Both samples have an emphasis on the ageing of cognitive functions as outcomes. As they have childhood intelligence test scores, the cohorts' data have been used to search for determinants of lifetime cognitive changes, and also cognitive change within old age. The cohorts' outcomes also include a range of physical and psycho-social aspects of well-being in old age. Both cohorts have a wide range of variables: genome-wide genotyping, demographics, psycho-social and lifestyle factors, cognitive functions, medical history and examination, and biomarkers (from blood and urine). The LBC1936 participants also have a detailed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. A range of scientific findings is described, to illustrate the possible uses of the cohorts.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify transcriptomic biomarkers of coronary heart disease (CHD) in 188 cases with CHD and 188 age- and sex-matched controls who were participants in the Framingham Heart Study. APPROACH AND RESULTS: A total of 35 genes were differentially expressed in cases with CHD versus controls at false discovery rate{\textless}0.5, including GZMB, TMEM56, and GUK1. Cluster analysis revealed 3 gene clusters associated with CHD, 2 linked to increased erythrocyte production and a third to reduced natural killer and T cell activity in cases with CHD. Exon-level results corroborated and extended the gene-level results. Alternative splicing analysis suggested that GUK1 and 38 other genes were differentially spliced in cases with CHD versus controls. Gene Ontology analysis linked ubiquitination and T-cell-related pathways with CHD. CONCLUSIONS: Two bioinformatically defined groups of genes show consistent associations with CHD. Our findings are consistent with the hypotheses that hematopoesis is upregulated in CHD, possibly reflecting a compensatory mechanism, and that innate immune activity is disrupted in CHD or altered by its treatment. Transcriptomic signatures may be useful in identifying pathways associated with CHD and point toward novel therapeutic targets for its treatment and prevention.},

Design, Setting, and Participants This meta-analysis assessed epigenome-wide associations in circulating TNF-$\alpha$ concentrations from 5 cohort studies and 1 interventional trial, with replication in 3 additional cohort studies. Follow-up analyses investigated associations of identified methylation loci with gene expression and incident coronary heart disease; this meta-analysis included 11 461 participants who experienced 1895 coronary events. Exposures Circulating TNF-$\alpha$ concentration. Main Outcomes and Measures DNA methylation at approximately 450 000 loci, neighboring DNA sequence variation, gene expression, and incident coronary heart disease. Results The discovery cohort included 4794 participants, and the replication study included 816 participants (overall mean [SD] age, 60.7 [8.5] years). In the discovery stage, circulating TNF-$\alpha$ levels were associated with methylation of 7 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, 3 of which were located in or nearDTX3L-PARP9 at cg00959259 ($\beta$ [SE] = −0.01 [0.003];P = 7.36 × 10−8), cg08122652 ($\beta$ [SE] = −0.008 [0.002];P = 2.24 × 10−7), and cg22930808($\beta$ [SE] = −0.01 [0.002];P = 6.92 × 10−8);NLRC5at cg16411857 ($\beta$ [SE] = −0.01 [0.002];P = 2.14 × 10−13) and cg07839457 ($\beta$ [SE] = −0.02 [0.003];P = 6.31 × 10−10); orABO, at cg13683939 ($\beta$ [SE] = 0.04 [0.008];P = 1.42 × 10−7) and cg24267699 ($\beta$ [SE] = −0.009 [0.002];P = 1.67 × 10−7), after accounting for multiple testing. Of these, negative associations between TNF-$\alpha$ concentration and methylation of 2 loci inNLRC5and 1 inDTX3L-14 PARP9were replicated.

Here we describe modifications to the minfi package required to support the HumanMethylationEPIC ('EPIC') array from Illumina. We discuss methods for the joint analysis and normalization of data from the HumanMethylation450 ('450k') and EPIC platforms. We introduce the single-sample Noob ( ssNoob ) method, a normalization procedure suitable for incremental preprocessing of individual methylation arrays and conclude that this method should be used when integrating data from multiple generations of Infinium methylation arrays. We show how to use reference 450k datasets to estimate cell type composition of samples on EPIC arrays. The cumulative effect of these updates is to ensure that minfi provides the tools to best integrate existing and forthcoming Illumina methylation array data.

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

abstract = {Although it is assumed that epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), underlie the relationship between adverse intrauterine conditions and adult metabolic health, evidence from human studies remains scarce. Therefore, we evaluated whether DNAm in whole blood mediated the association between prenatal famine exposure and metabolic health in 422 individuals exposed to famine in utero and 463 (sibling) controls. We implemented a two-step analysis, namely, a genome-wide exploration across 342,596 cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) for potential mediators of the association between prenatal famine exposure and adult body mass index (BMI), serum triglycerides (TG), or glucose concentrations, which was followed by formal mediation analysis. DNAm mediated the association of prenatal famine exposure with adult BMI and TG but not with glucose. DNAm at PIM3 (cg09349128), a gene involved in energy metabolism, mediated 13.4{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 5 to 28{\%}] of the association between famine exposure and BMI. DNAm at six CpGs, including TXNIP (cg19693031), influencing $\beta$ cell function, and ABCG1 (cg07397296), affecting lipid metabolism, together mediated 80{\%} (95{\%} CI, 38.5 to 100{\%}) of the association between famine exposure and TG. Analyses restricted to those exposed to famine during early gestation identified additional CpGs mediating the relationship with TG near PFKFB3 (glycolysis) and METTL8 (adipogenesis). DNAm at the CpGs involved was associated with gene expression in an external data set and correlated with DNAm levels in fat depots in additional postmortem data. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms mediate the influence of transient adverse environmental factors in early life on long-term metabolic health. The specific mechanism awaits elucidation.},

abstract = {Cross-study validation (CSV) of prediction models is an alternative to traditional cross-validation (CV) in domains where multiple comparable datasets are available. Although many studies have noted potential sources of heterogeneity in genomic studies, to our knowledge none have systematically investigated their intertwined impacts on prediction accuracy across studies. We employ a hybrid parametric/non-parametric bootstrap method to realistically simulate publicly available compendia of microarray, RNA-seq, and whole metagenome shotgun (WMS) microbiome studies of health outcomes. Three types of heterogeneity between studies are manipulated and studied: 1) imbalances in the prevalence of clinical and pathological covariates, 2) differences in gene covariance that could be caused by batch, platform, or tumor purity effects, and 3) differences in the "true" model that associates gene expression and clinical factors to outcome. We assess model accuracy while altering these factors. Lower accuracy is seen in CSV than in CV. Surprisingly, heterogeneity in known clinical covariates and differences in gene covariance structure have very limited contributions in the loss of accuracy when validating in new studies. However, forcing identical generative models greatly reduces the within/across study difference. These results, observed consistently for multiple disease outcomes and omics platforms, suggest that the most easily identifiable sources of study heterogeneity are not necessarily the primary ones that undermine the ability to accurately replicate the accuracy of omics prediction models in new studies. Unidentified heterogeneity, such as could arise from unmeasured confounding, may be more important.},

Unfortunately, technical heterogeneity or batch effects (different experiment times, handlers, reagent lots, etc.) have proven challenging. Although batch effect-correction algorithms (BECAs) exist, we know little about effective batch-effect mitigation: even now, new batch effect-associated problems are emerging. These include false effects due to misapplying BECAs and positive bias during model evaluations. Depending on the choice of algorithm and experimental set-up, biological heterogeneity can be mistaken for batch effects and wrongfully removed. Here, we examine these emerging batch effect-associated problems, propose a series of best practices, and discuss some of the challenges that lie ahead.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is not yet known whether DNA methylation levels can be used to accurately predict age across a broad spectrum of human tissues and cell types, nor whether the resulting age prediction is a biologically meaningful measure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: I developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types. The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock can be used to address a host of questions in developmental biology, cancer and aging research.},

abstract = {In recent years the Illumina HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip has provided a user-friendly platform to profile DNA methylation in human samples. However, HM450 lacked coverage of distal regulatory elements. Illumina have now released the MethylationEPIC (EPIC) BeadChip, with new content specifically designed to target these regions. We have used HM450 and whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) to perform a critical evaluation of the new EPIC array platform. EPIC covers over 850,000 CpG sites, including {\textgreater}90 {\%} of the CpGs from the HM450 and an additional 413,743 CpGs. Even though the additional probes improve the coverage of regulatory elements, including 58 {\%} of FANTOM5 enhancers, only 7 {\%} distal and 27 {\%} proximal ENCODE regulatory elements are represented. Detailed comparisons of regulatory elements from EPIC and WGBS show that a single EPIC probe is not always informative for those distal regulatory elements showing variable methylation across the region. However, overall data from the EPIC array at single loci are highly reproducible across technical and biological replicates and demonstrate high correlation with HM450 and WGBS data. We show that the HM450 and EPIC arrays distinguish differentially methylated probes, but the absolute agreement depends on the threshold set for each platform. Finally, we provide an annotated list of probes whose signal could be affected by cross-hybridisation or underlying genetic variation. The EPIC array is a significant improvement over the HM450 array, with increased genome coverage of regulatory regions and high reproducibility and reliability, providing a valuable tool for high-throughput human methylome analyses from diverse clinical samples.},

Although the mechanisms linking adiposity to associated clinical conditions are poorly understood, recent studies suggest that adiposity may influence DNA methylation 3–6 , a key regulator of gene expression and molecular phenotype 7 . Here we use epigenome-wide association to show that body mass index (BMI; a key measure of adiposity) is associated with widespread changes in DNA methylation (187 genetic loci with P {\textless} 1 × 10 −7 , range P = 9.2 × 10 −8 to 6.0 × 10 −46 ; n = 10,261 samples). Genetic association analyses demonstrate that the alterations in DNA methylation are predominantly the consequence of adiposity, rather than the cause. We find that methylation loci are enriched for functional genomic features in multiple tissues (P {\textless} 0.05), and show that sentinel methylation markers identify gene expression signatures at 38 loci (P {\textless} 9.0 × 10 −6 , range P = 5.5 × 10 −6 to 6.1 × 10 −35 , n = 1,785 samples). The methylation loci identify genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, substrate transport and inflammatory pathways. Finally, we show that the disturbances in DNA methylation predict future development of type 2 diabetes (relative risk per 1 standard deviation increase in methylation risk score: 2.3 (2.07–2.56); P = 1.1 × 10 −54},

abstract = {Monocytes and the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages into sites of inflammation play a key role in atherogenesis and other chronic inflammatory diseases linked to cardiometabolic syndrome and obesity. Previous studies from our group have shown that metabolic stress promotes monocyte priming, i.e., enhanced adhesion and accelerated chemotaxis of monocytes in response to chemokines, both in vitro and in dyslipidemic LDLR(-/-) mice. We also showed that metabolic stress-induced monocyte dysfunction is, at least to a large extent caused by the S-glutathionylation, inactivation, and subsequent degradation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1. Here, we analyzed the effects of a Western-style, dyslipidemic diet (DD), which was composed of high levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and simple sugars, on monocyte (dys)function in non-human primates (NHPs). We found that similar to mice, a DD enhances monocyte chemotaxis in NHP within 4 weeks, occurring concordantly with the onset of hypercholesterolemia but prior to changes in triglycerides, blood glucose, monocytosis, or changes in monocyte subset composition. In addition, we identified transitory decreases in the acetylation of histone H3 at the lysine residues 18 and 23 in metabolically primed monocytes, and we found that monocyte priming was correlated with the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 after an 8-week DD regimen. Our data show that metabolic stress promotes monocyte priming and hyper-chemotactic responses in NHP. The histone modifications accompanying monocyte priming in primates suggest a reprogramming of the epigenetic landscape, which may lead to dysregulated responses and functionalities in macrophages derived from primed monocytes that are recruited to sites of inflammation.},

abstract = {Background and aims The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the association between DNA methylation and coronary heart disease (CHD) or related atherosclerotic traits. Methods A systematic review was designed. The condition of interest was DNA methylation, and the outcome was CHD or other atherosclerosis-related traits. Three DNA methylation approaches were considered: global methylation, candidate-gene, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). A functional analysis was undertaken using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Results In total, 51 articles were included in the analysis: 12 global methylation, 34 candidate-gene and 11 EWAS, with six studies using more than one approach. The results of the global methylation studies were inconsistent. The candidate-gene results were consistent for some genes, suggesting that hypermethylation in ESR$\alpha$, ABCG1 and FOXP3 and hypomethylation in IL-6 were associated with CHD. The EWAS identified 84 genes showing differential methylation associated with CHD in more than one study. The probability of these findings was {\textless}1.37{\textperiodcentered}10−5. One third of these genes have been related to obesity in genome-wide association studies. The functional analysis identified several diseases and functions related to these set of genes: inflammatory, metabolic and cardiovascular disease. Conclusions Global DNA methylation seems to be not associated with CHD. The evidence from candidate-gene studies was limited. The EWAS identified a set of 84 genes highlighting the relevance of obesity, inflammation, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in CHD. This set of genes could be prioritized in future studies assessing the role of DNA methylation in CHD.},

abstract = {The extent to which genetic influences on cardiovascular disease risk are mediated by changes in DNA methylation levels has not been systematically explored. We developed an analytical framework that integrates genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization with epigenome-wide association studies to evaluate the causal relationships between methylation levels and 14 cardiovascular disease traits. We identified ten genetic loci known to influence proximal DNA methylation which were also associated with cardiovascular traits after multiple-testing correction. Bivariate fine mapping provided evidence that the individual variants responsible for the observed effects on cardiovascular traits at the ADCY3 and ADIPOQ loci were potentially mediated through changes in DNA methylation, although we highlight that we are unable to reliably separate causality from horizontal pleiotropy. Estimates of causal effects were replicated with results from large-scale consortia. Genetic variants and CpG sites identified in this study were enriched for histone mark peaks in relevant tissue types and gene promoter regions. Integrating our results with expression quantitative trait loci data, we provide evidence that variation at these regulatory regions is likely to also influence gene expression levels at these loci.},

In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

METHODS AND RESULTS We used Cox proportional-hazards regression to evaluate the risk of developing a first CVD event in 8491 Framingham study participants (mean age, 49 years; 4522 women) who attended a routine examination between 30 and 74 years of age and were free of CVD. Sex-specific multivariable risk functions ("general CVD" algorithms) were derived that incorporated age, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, smoking, and diabetes status. We assessed the performance of the general CVD algorithms for predicting individual CVD events (coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or heart failure). Over 12 years of follow-up, 1174 participants (456 women) developed a first CVD event. All traditional risk factors evaluated predicted CVD risk (multivariable-adjusted P{\textless}0.0001). The general CVD algorithm demonstrated good discrimination (C statistic, 0.763 [men] and 0.793 [women]) and calibration. Simple adjustments to the general CVD risk algorithms allowed estimation of the risks of each CVD component. Two simple risk scores are presented, 1 based on all traditional risk factors and the other based on non-laboratory-based predictors. CONCLUSIONS A sex-specific multivariable risk factor algorithm can be conveniently used to assess general CVD risk and risk of individual CVD events (coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease and heart failure). The estimated absolute CVD event rates can be used to quantify risk and to guide preventive care.},

abstract = {PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for even faster and more scalable implementations of key functions. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain probabilistic calls, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(sqrt(n))-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. This will be followed by PLINK 2.0, which will introduce (a) a new data format capable of efficiently representing probabilities, phase, and multiallelic variants, and (b) extensions of many functions to account for the new types of information. The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.},

abstract = {Epigenome-wide association studies using DNA methylation have the potential to uncover novel biomarkers and mechanisms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, the direction of causation for these associations is not always clear, and investigations to-date have generally failed to replicate at the level of individual loci. Here, we undertook module- and region-based DNA methylation analyses of incident CVD in the Women{\&}{\#}039;s Health Initiative (WHI) and Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (FHS) in order to find more robust epigenetic biomarkers for cardiovascular risk. We applied weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and the Comb-p algorithm to find methylation modules and regions associated with incident CVD in the WHI dataset. We discovered two modules whose activation correlated with CVD risk and replicated across cohorts. One of these modules was enriched for development-related processes and overlaps strongly with epigenetic aging sites. For the other, we showed preliminary evidence for monocyte-specific effects and statistical links to cumulative exposure to traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally, we found three regions (associated with the genes SLC9A1, SLC1A5, and TNRC6C) whose methylation associates with CVD risk. In sum, we present several epigenetic associations with incident CVD that reveal disease mechanisms related to development and monocyte biology. Furthermore, we show that epigenetic modules may act as a molecular readout of cumulative cardiovascular risk factor exposure, with implications for the improvement of clinical risk prediction.},
