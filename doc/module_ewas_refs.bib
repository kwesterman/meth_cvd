abstract = {Although age-associated gene expression and methylation changes have been reported throughout the literature, the unifying epigenomic principles of aging remain poorly understood. Recent explosion in availability and resolution of functional/regulatory genome annotation data (epigenomic data), such as that provided by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, provides an opportunity for the identification of epigenomic mechanisms potentially altered by age-associated differentially methylated regions (aDMRs) and regulatory signatures in the promoters of age-associated genes (aGENs). In this study we found that aDMRs and aGENs identified in multiple independent studies share a common Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 signature marked by EZH2, SUZ12, CTCF binding sites, repressive H3K27me3, and activating H3K4me1 histone modification marks, and a "poised promoter" chromatin state. This signature is depleted in RNA Polymerase II-associated transcription factor binding sites, activating H3K79me2, H3K36me3, H3K27ac marks, and an "active promoter" chromatin state. The PRC2 signature was shown to be generally stable across cell types. When considering the directionality of methylation changes, we found the PRC2 signature to be associated with aDMRs hypermethylated with age, while hypomethylated aDMRs were associated with enhancers. In contrast, aGENs were associated with the PRC2 signature independently of the directionality of gene expression changes. In this study we demonstrate that the PRC2 signature is the common epigenomic context of genomic regions associated with hypermethylation and gene expression changes in aging.},

Continuous surveillance of this sample of 5209 subjects has been maintained through biennial physical examinations. In 1971 examinations were begun on the children of the FHS cohort. This study, called the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS), was undertaken to expand upon knowledge of cardiovascular disease, particularly in the area of familial clustering of the disease and its risk factors. This report reviews the sampling design of the FHS and describes the nature of the FOS sample. The FOS families appear to be of typical size and age structure for families with parents born in the late 19th or early 20th century. In addition, there is little evidence that coronary heart disease (CHD) experience and CHD risk factors differ in parents of those who volunteered for this study and the parents of those who did not volunteer.},

abstract = {The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a large and complex clinical investigation of strategies for the prevention and control of some of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among postmenopausal women, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporotic fractures. The WHI was initiated in 1992, with a planned completion date of 2007. Postmenopausal women ranging in age from 50 to 79 are enrolled at one of 40 WHI clinical centers nationwide into either a clinical trial (CT) that will include about 64,500 women or an observational study (OS) that will include about 100,000 women. The CT is designed to allow randomized controlled evaluation of three distinct interventions: a low-fat eating pattern, hypothesized to prevent breast cancer and colorectal cancer and, secondarily, coronary heart disease; hormone replacement therapy, hypothesized to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases and, secondarily, to reduce the risk of hip and other fractures, with increased breast cancer risk as a possible adverse outcome; and calcium and vitamin D supplementation, hypothesized to prevent hip fractures and, secondarily, other fractures and colorectal cancer. Overall benefit-versus-risk assessment is a central focus in each of the three CT components. Women are screened for participation in one or both of the components—dietary modification (DM) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)—of the CT, which will randomize 48,000 and 27,500 women, respectively. Women who prove to be ineligible for, or who are unwilling to enroll in, these CT components are invited to enroll in the OS. At their 1-year anniversary of randomization, CT women are invited to be further randomized into the calcium and vitamin D (CaD) trial component, which is projected to include 45,000 women. The average follow-up for women in either CT or OS is approximately 9 years. Concerted efforts are made to enroll women of racial and ethnic minority groups, with a target of 20{\%} of overall enrollment in both the CT and OS. This article gives a brief description of the rationale for the interventions being studied in each of the CT components and for the inclusion of the OS component. Some detail is provided on specific study design choices, including eligibility criteria, recruitment strategy, and sample size, with attention to the partial factorial design of the CT. Some aspects of the CT monitoring approach are also outlined. The scientific and logistic complexity of the WHI implies particular leadership and management challenges. The WHI organization and committee structure employed to respond to these challenges is also briefly described.},

abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for `soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion).We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the `weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its `unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding.We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

Chronic stress is linked with several lasting biological consequences, particularly to the stress endocrine system but also affecting intermediate phenotypes such as brain structure and function, immune function, and behavior. Although genetic predisposition confers a proportion of the risk, the most relevant molecular mechanisms determining those susceptible and resilient to the effects of stress and trauma may be epigenetic. Epigenetics refers to the mechanisms that regulate genomic information by dynamically changing the patterns of transcription and translation of genes.

abstract = {In many applications, one is interested in determining which of the properties of a network module change across conditions. For example, to validate the existence of a module, it is desirable to show that it is reproducible (or preserved) in an independent test network. Here we study several types of network preservation statistics that do not require a module assignment in the test network. We distinguish network preservation statistics by the type of the underlying network. Some preservation statistics are defined for a general network (defined by an adjacency matrix) while others are only defined for a correlation network (constructed on the basis of pairwise correlations between numeric variables). Our applications show that the correlation structure facilitates the definition of particularly powerful module preservation statistics. We illustrate that evaluating module preservation is in general different from evaluating cluster preservation. We find that it is advantageous to aggregate multiple preservation statistics into summary preservation statistics. We illustrate the use of these methods in six gene co-expression network applications including 1) preservation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in mouse tissues, 2) comparison of human and chimpanzee brain networks, 3) preservation of selected KEGG pathways between human and chimpanzee brain networks, 4) sex differences in human cortical networks, 5) sex differences in mouse liver networks. While we find no evidence for sex specific modules in human cortical networks, we find that several human cortical modules are less preserved in chimpanzees. In particular, apoptosis genes are differentially co-expressed between humans and chimpanzees. Our simulation studies and applications show that module preservation statistics are useful for studying differences between the modular structure of networks.

We discuss methods for the joint analysis and normalization of data from the HumanMethylation450 ('450k') and EPIC platforms. We introduce the single-sample Noob ( ssNoob ) method, a normalization procedure suitable for incremental preprocessing of individual methylation arrays and conclude that this method should be used when integrating data from multiple generations of Infinium methylation arrays. We show how to use reference 450k datasets to estimate cell type composition of samples on EPIC arrays. The cumulative effect of these updates is to ensure that minfi provides the tools to best integrate existing and forthcoming Illumina methylation array data.

abstract = {As the most stable and experimentally accessible epigenetic mark, DNA methylation is of great interest to the research community. The landscape of DNA methylation across tissues, through development and in disease pathogenesis is not yet well characterized. Thus there is a need for rapid and cost effective methods for assessing genome-wide levels of DNA methylation. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip is a very useful addition to the available methods for DNA methylation analysis but its complex design, incorporating two different assay methods, requires careful consideration. Accordingly, several normalization schemes have been published. We have taken advantage of known DNA methylation patterns associated with genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in addition to the performance of SNP genotyping assays present on the array, to derive three independent metrics which we use to test alternative schemes of correction and normalization. These metrics also have potential utility as quality scores for datasets. The standard index of DNA methylation at any specific CpG site is $\beta$ = M/(M + U + 100) where M and U are methylated and unmethylated signal intensities, respectively. Betas ($\beta$s) calculated from raw signal intensities (the default GenomeStudio behavior) perform well, but using 11 methylomic datasets we demonstrate that quantile normalization methods produce marked improvement, even in highly consistent data, by all three metrics. The commonly used procedure of normalizing betas is inferior to the separate normalization of M and U, and it is also advantageous to normalize Type I and Type II assays separately. More elaborate manipulation of quantiles proves to be counterproductive. Careful selection of preprocessing steps can minimize variance and thus improve statistical power, especially for the detection of the small absolute DNA methylation changes likely associated with complex disease phenotypes. For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called wateRmelon, downloadable from bioConductor, compatible with the existing methylumi, minfi and IMA packages, that allows others to utilize the same normalization methods and data quality tests on 450K data.},

While the first generation of epigenetic biomarkers of aging were developed using chronological age as a surrogate for biological age, we hypothesized that incorporation of composite clinical measures of phenotypic age that capture differences in lifespan and healthspan may identify novel CpGs and facilitate the development of a more powerful epigenetic biomarker of aging. Using an innovative two-step process, we develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions for a variety of aging outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cancers, healthspan, physical functioning, and Alzheimer's disease. While this biomarker was developed using data from whole blood, it correlates strongly with age in every tissue and cell tested. Based on an in-depth transcriptional analysis in sorted cells, we find that increased epigenetic, relative to chronological age, is associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage response, and mitochondrial signatures. Overall, this single epigenetic biomarker of aging is able to capture risks for an array of diverse outcomes across multiple tissues and cells, and provide insight into important pathways in aging.},

We present a genome-wide screen yielding 687 MEs and track their trajectories across nine developmental stages in human in vitro fertilization embryos. MEs exhibit highly unusual methylation dynamics across the implantation-gastrulation transition, producing a large excess of intermediate methylation states, suggesting the potential for differential programming in response to external signals. Using a natural experiment in rural Gambia, we show that genomic regions sensitive to season of conception are highly enriched for MEs and show similar atypical methylation patterns. MEs are enriched for proximal enhancers and transcription start sites and are influenced by genotype. Together, these observations position MEs as distinctive epigenomic features programmed in the early embryo, sensitive to genetic and periconceptional environment, and with the potential to influence phenotype.},

abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that multiple spatially, temporally, and functionally distinct pools of cyclic nucleotides exist and regulate cardiac performance, from acute myocardial contractility to chronic gene expression and cardiac structural remodeling. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), by hydrolyzing cAMP and cyclic GMP, regulate the amplitude, duration, and compartmentation of cyclic nucleotide-mediated signaling. In particular, PDE3 enzymes play a major role in regulating cAMP metabolism in the cardiovascular system. PDE3 inhibitors, by raising cAMP content, have acute inotropic and vasodilatory effects in treating congestive heart failure but have increased mortality in long-term therapy. PDE3A expression is downregulated in human and animal failing hearts. In vitro, inhibition of PDE3A function is associated with myocyte apoptosis through sustained induction of a transcriptional repressor ICER (inducible cAMP early repressor) and thereby inhibition of antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 expression. Sustained induction of ICER may also cause the change of other protein expression implicated in human and animal failing hearts. These data suggest that the downregulation of PDE3A observed in failing hearts may play a causative role in the progression of heart failure, in part, by inducing ICER and promoting cardiac myocyte dysfunction. Hence, strategies that maintain PDE3A function may represent an attractive approach to circumvent myocyte apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction.},

abstract = {With a view of understanding the potential roles of phosphodiesterase (PDE)3 in the acceleration of atherosclerosis in diabetes, we have analyzed the in vivo levels of low Km cAMP PDE3 and PDE4 activities as well as PDE3A and PDE3B mRNA in a relevant animal model. The JCR:LA-cp rat is a unique strain that develops obesity, insulin resistance, and vasculopathy when homozygous for the autosomal recessive cp gene (cp/cp). Lean rats, bred (designated +/?) as a 2:1 mixture of animals that are heterozygous (cp/+) or homozygous normal (+/+), are metabolically normal. We find that PDE3 activity is the major low Km cAMP activity in the aorta of cp/cp rats and is approximately twofold higher than that in lean +/? rats. PDE3A mRNA levels in middle-aged cp/cp rats are also elevated, approximately threefold, compared with those of +/? rats or young 12-week-old cp/cp rats. Thus, in the aorta of atherosclerosis-prone insulin-resistant cp/cp rats, PDE3A gene expression is upregulated, resulting in significantly higher PDE3 activity. This upregulation of PDE3A mRNA levels was a rather unique phenomenon to the aorta of JCR:LA-cp rats compared with that in the aorta of other rat strains. This result is consistent with our hypothesis that an increased PDE3 activity in aortic smooth muscle cells may contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes. Furthermore, determination of PDE3 activity and PDE3A and PDE3B mRNA levels in heart and white and brown fat tissues of JCR:LA-cp rats revealed that PDE3B mRNA and activity in white adipose tissue is downregulated in this diabetic animal model, and that PDE3A and PDE3B genes are tissue-specifically expressed and differentially regulated in aorta and adipose tissue, respectively, under hyperinsulinemic conditions.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death worldwide, and hypertension is the major risk factor. Mendelian hypertension elucidates mechanisms of blood pressure regulation. Here we report six missense mutations in PDE3A (encoding phosphodiesterase 3A) in six unrelated families with mendelian hypertension and brachydactyly type E (HTNB). The syndrome features brachydactyly type E (BDE), severe salt-independent but age-dependent hypertension, an increased fibroblast growth rate, neurovascular contact at the rostral-ventrolateral medulla, altered baroreflex blood pressure regulation and death from stroke before age 50 years when untreated. In vitro analyses of mesenchymal stem cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and chondrocytes provided insights into molecular pathogenesis. The mutations increased protein kinase A-mediated PDE3A phosphorylation and resulted in gain of function, with increased cAMP-hydrolytic activity and enhanced cell proliferation. Levels of phosphorylated VASP were diminished, and PTHrP levels were dysregulated. We suggest that the identified PDE3A mutations cause the syndrome. VSMC-expressed PDE3A deserves scrutiny as a therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension.},

To advance the complex interpretation of EWAS, we developed eFORGE (http://eforge.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), a new standalone and web-based tool for the analysis and interpretation of EWAS data. eFORGE determines the cell type-specific regulatory component of a set of EWAS-identified differentially methylated positions. This is achieved by detecting enrichment of overlap with DNase I hypersensitive sites across 454 samples (tissues, primary cell types, and cell lines) from the ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and BLUEPRINT projects. Application of eFORGE to 20 publicly available EWAS datasets identified disease-relevant cell types for several common diseases, a stem cell-like signature in cancer, and demonstrated the ability to detect cell-composition effects for EWAS performed on heterogeneous tissues. Our approach bridges the gap between large-scale epigenomics data and EWAS-derived target selection to yield insight into disease etiology.},

The epigenome is especially intriguing as a target for study, as epigenetic regulatory processes are, by definition, heritable from parent to daughter cells and are found to have transcriptional regulatory properties. As such, the epigenome is an attractive candidate for mediating long-term responses to cellular stimuli, such as environmental effects modifying disease risk. Such epigenomic studies represent a broader category of disease -omics, which suffer from multiple problems in design and execution that severely limit their interpretability. Here we define many of the problems with current epigenomic studies and propose solutions that can be applied to allow this and other disease -omics studies to achieve their potential for generating valuable insights.},

The resulting dataset identified characteristic differences between HSCs derived from fetal liver, cord blood, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. We also observed lineage-specific DNA methylation between myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, characterized immature multi-lymphoid progenitors, and detected progressive DNA methylation differences in maturing megakaryocytes. We linked these patterns to gene expression, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility, and we used machine learning to derive a model of human hematopoietic differentiation directly from DNA methylation data.

abstract = {Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third-leading cause of death worldwide. Identifying COPD-associated DNA methylation marks in African-Americans may contribute to our understanding of racial disparities in COPD susceptibility. We determined differentially methylated genes and co-methylation network modules associated with COPD in African-Americans recruited during exacerbations of COPD and smoking controls from the Pennsylvania Study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Exacerbations (PA-SCOPE) cohort. Methods: We assessed DNA methylation from whole blood samples in 362 African-American smokers in the PA-SCOPE cohort using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Array. Final analysis included 19302 CpG probes annotated to the nearest gene transcript after quality control. We tested methylation associations with COPD case-control status using mixed linear models. Weighted gene comethylation networks were constructed using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and network modules were analyzed for association with COPD. Results: There were five differentially methylated CpG probes significantly associated with COPD among African-Americans at an FDR less than 5 {\%}, and seven additional probes that approached significance at an FDR less than 10 {\%}. The top ranked gene association was MAML1, which has been shown to affect NOTCH-dependent angiogenesis in murine lung. Network modeling yielded the "yellow" and "blue" comethylation modules which were significantly associated with COPD (p-value 4 x 10-10 and 4 x 10-9, respectively). The yellow module was enriched for gene sets related to inflammatory pathways known to be relevant to COPD. The blue module contained the top ranked genes in the concurrent differential methylation analysis (FXYD1/LGI4, gene significance p-value 1.2 x 10-26; MAML1, p-value 2.0 x 10-26; CD72, p-value 2.1 x 10-25; and LPO, p-value 7.2 x 10-25), and was significantly associated with lung development processes in Gene Ontology gene-set enrichment analysis. Conclusion: We identified 12 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with COPD that mapped to biologically plausible genes. Network module comethylation patterns have identified candidate genes that may be contributing to racial differences in COPD susceptibility and severity. COPD-associated comethylation modules contained genes previously associated with lung disease and inflammation and recapitulated known COPD-associated genes. The genes implicated by differential methylation and WGCNA analysis may provide mechanistic targets contributing to COPD susceptibility, exacerbations, and outcomes among African-Americans.

In order to elucidate the role of gene regulatory changes during this process, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the complete transcriptome and epigenome of human monocytes that were differentiated in vitro by addition of colony-stimulating factor 1 in serum-free medium. Numerous mRNAs and miRNAs were significantly up- or down-regulated. More than 100 discrete DNA regions, most often far away from transcription start sites, were rapidly demethylated by the ten eleven translocation enzymes, became nucleosome-free and gained histone marks indicative of active enhancers. These regions were unique for macrophages and associated with genes involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, phagocytosis and innate immune response. In summary, we have discovered a phagocytic gene network that is repressed by DNA methylation in monocytes and rapidly de-repressed after the onset of macrophage differentiation.},

abstract = {Monocytes and the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages into sites of inflammation play a key role in atherogenesis and other chronic inflammatory diseases linked to cardiometabolic syndrome and obesity. Previous studies from our group have shown that metabolic stress promotes monocyte priming, i.e., enhanced adhesion and accelerated chemotaxis of monocytes in response to chemokines, both in vitro and in dyslipidemic LDLR(-/-) mice. We also showed that metabolic stress-induced monocyte dysfunction is, at least to a large extent caused by the S-glutathionylation, inactivation, and subsequent degradation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1. Here, we analyzed the effects of a Western-style, dyslipidemic diet (DD), which was composed of high levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and simple sugars, on monocyte (dys)function in non-human primates (NHPs). We found that similar to mice, a DD enhances monocyte chemotaxis in NHP within 4 weeks, occurring concordantly with the onset of hypercholesterolemia but prior to changes in triglycerides, blood glucose, monocytosis, or changes in monocyte subset composition. In addition, we identified transitory decreases in the acetylation of histone H3 at the lysine residues 18 and 23 in metabolically primed monocytes, and we found that monocyte priming was correlated with the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 after an 8-week DD regimen. Our data show that metabolic stress promotes monocyte priming and hyper-chemotactic responses in NHP. The histone modifications accompanying monocyte priming in primates suggest a reprogramming of the epigenetic landscape, which may lead to dysregulated responses and functionalities in macrophages derived from primed monocytes that are recruited to sites of inflammation.},

A deeper understanding of TNF-$\alpha$ biology may enhance treatment precision. Objective To conduct an epigenome-wide analysis of blood-derived DNA methylation and TNF-$\alpha$ levels and to assess the clinical relevance of findings. Design, Setting, and Participants This meta-analysis assessed epigenome-wide associations in circulating TNF-$\alpha$ concentrations from 5 cohort studies and 1 interventional trial, with replication in 3 additional cohort studies. Follow-up analyses investigated associations of identified methylation loci with gene expression and incident coronary heart disease; this meta-analysis included 11 461 participants who experienced 1895 coronary events. Exposures Circulating TNF-$\alpha$ concentration. Main Outcomes and Measures DNA methylation at approximately 450 000 loci, neighboring DNA sequence variation, gene expression, and incident coronary heart disease. Results The discovery cohort included 4794 participants, and the replication study included 816 participants (overall mean [SD] age, 60.7 [8.5] years). In the discovery stage, circulating TNF-$\alpha$ levels were associated with methylation of 7 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, 3 of which were located in or nearDTX3L-PARP9 at cg00959259 ($\beta$ [SE] = −0.01 [0.003];P = 7.36 × 10−8), cg08122652 ($\beta$ [SE] = −0.008 [0.002];P = 2.24 × 10−7), and cg22930808($\beta$ [SE] = −0.01 [0.002];P = 6.92 × 10−8);NLRC5at cg16411857 ($\beta$ [SE] = −0.01 [0.002];P = 2.14 × 10−13) and cg07839457 ($\beta$ [SE] = −0.02 [0.003];P = 6.31 × 10−10); orABO, at cg13683939 ($\beta$ [SE] = 0.04 [0.008];P = 1.42 × 10−7) and cg24267699 ($\beta$ [SE] = −0.009 [0.002];P = 1.67 × 10−7), after accounting for multiple testing. Of these, negative associations between TNF-$\alpha$ concentration and methylation of 2 loci inNLRC5and 1 inDTX3L-14 PARP9were replicated.

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Since its beginning, the Framingham study has been a leader in identifying CVD risk factors. Clinical trials have demonstrated that when the modifiable risk factors are treated and corrected, the chances of CVD occurring can be reduced. The Framingham study also recognized that CVD risk factors are multifactorial and interact over time to produce CVD. In response, Framingham investigators developed the Framingham Risk Functions (also called Framingham Risk Scores) to evaluate the chance or likelihood of developing CVD in individuals. These functions are multivariate functions (algorithms) that combine the information in CVD risk factors such as sex, age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking behavior, and diabetes status to produce an estimate (or risk) of developing CVD or a component of CVD (such as coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or heart failure) over a fixed time, for example, the next 10 years. These estimates of CVD risk are often major inputs in recommending drug treatments such as cholesterol-lowering drugs. {\textcopyright} 2013 World Heart Federation (Geneva).

abstract = {Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality in African Americans. To identify common genetic polymorphisms associated with CHD and its risk factors (LDL- and HDL-cholesterol (LDL-C and HDL-C), hypertension, smoking, and type-2 diabetes) in individuals of African ancestry, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 8,090 African Americans from five population-based cohorts. We replicated 17 loci previously associated with CHD or its risk factors in Caucasians. For five of these regions (CHD: CDKN2A/CDKN2B; HDL-C: FADS1-3, PLTP, LPL, and ABCA1), we could leverage the distinct linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in African Americans to identify DNA polymorphisms more strongly associated with the phenotypes than the previously reported index SNPs found in Caucasian populations. We also developed a new approach for association testing in admixed populations that uses allelic and local ancestry variation. Using this method, we discovered several loci that would have been missed using the basic allelic and global ancestry information only. Our conclusions suggest that no major loci uniquely explain the high prevalence of CHD in African Americans. Our project has developed resources and methods that address both admixture- and SNP-association to maximize power for genetic discovery in even larger African-American consortia.},

To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS: Liver fibrogenesis - scarring of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer - is characterized by hepatocyte impairment, capillarization of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. To date, the molecular determinants of a healthy human liver cell phenotype remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we assess the transcriptome and the genome-wide promoter methylome specific for purified, non-cultured human hepatocytes, LSECs and HSCs, and investigate the nature of epigenetic changes accompanying transcriptional changes associated with activation of HSCs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression profile and promoter methylome of purified, uncultured human liver cells and culture-activated HSCs were respectively determined using Affymetrix HG-U219 genechips and by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled to promoter array hybridization. Histone modification patterns were assessed at the single-gene level by chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: We unveil a DNA-methylation-based epigenetic relationship between hepatocytes, LSECs and HSCs despite their distinct ontogeny. We show that liver cell type-specific DNA methylation targets early developmental and differentiation-associated functions. Integrative analysis of promoter methylome and transcriptome reveals partial concordance between DNA methylation and transcriptional changes associated with human HSC activation. Further, we identify concordant histone methylation and acetylation changes in the promoter and putative novel enhancer elements of genes involved in liver fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first epigenetic blueprint of three distinct freshly isolated, human hepatic cell types and of epigenetic changes elicited upon HSC activation.},

Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) of hypertension status, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, to assess the odds of incident hypertension at year 3 of follow-up in association with the factors included in the baseline models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: At year 3 of follow-up, 27.3{\%} of Hispanic women who were normotensive at baseline had progressed to prehypertension, and 9.0{\%} had become hypertensive. Among the prehypertensive participants at baseline, 30.4{\%} had progressed to hypertension. Compared with normotensive Hispanic women, hypertensive participants had a higher number of cardiovascular risk factors: body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2) (OR = 3.76; 95{\%} CI = 3.01-4.71), a family history of diabetes, stroke, and/or myocardial infarction (OR = 1.12; 95{\%} CI 1.03-1.23), treated hypercholesterolemia (OR = 1.57; 95{\%} CI = 1.23-1.99), treated diabetes (OR = 2.04; 95{\%} CI = 1.40-2.97), and a history of cardiovascular disease (OR = 2.04; 95{\%} CI = 1.58-2.64).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Hispanic women seem to experience an increased risk of incident hypertension in later adulthood.

abstract = {Fibrosis is the formation of fibrous connective tissue in response to injury. It is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix components, particularly collagen, at the site of injury. Fibrosis is an adaptive response that is a vital component of wound healing and tissue repair. However, its continued activation is highly detrimental and a common final pathway of numerous disease states including cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Worldwide, fibrotic diseases cause over 800,000 deaths per year, accounting for {\~{}}45{\%} of total deaths. With an aging population, the incidence of fibrotic disease and subsequently the number of fibrosis-related deaths will rise further. Although, fibrosis is a well-recognized cause of morbidity and mortality in a range of disease states, there are currently no viable therapies to reverse the effects of chronic fibrosis. Numerous predisposing factors contribute to the development of fibrosis. Biological aging in particular, interferes with repair of damaged tissue, accelerating the transition to pathological remodeling, rather than a process of resolution and regeneration. When fibrosis progresses in an uncontrolled manner, it results in the irreversible stiffening of the affected tissue, which can lead to organ malfunction and death. Further investigation into the mechanisms of fibrosis is necessary to elucidate novel, much needed, therapeutic targets. Fibrosis of the heart and lung make up a significant proportion of fibrosis-related deaths. It has long been established that the heart and lung are functionally and geographically linked when it comes to health and disease, and thus exploring the processes and mechanisms that contribute to fibrosis of each organ, the focus of this review, may help to highlight potential avenues of therapeutic investigation.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of ApoB polymorphisms on the risk of MI and plasma apoB levels in a Chinese population. Eight polymorphisms (rs676210, rs679899, rs3791980, rs2854725, rs11676704, rs512535, rs12720841 and rs2678379) in ApoB gene were genotyped in a case-control study in China, including 550 MI cases and 550 healthy controls. Carriers of GG genotype of rs676210 had significant increased risk of MI [odd ratio (OR) = 1.93, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.23-3.03] compared to carriers of AA genotype. Haplotype analysis also showed that GTTGG (rs676210-rs2854725-rs11676704-rs3791980-rs2678379) haplotype had significant increased risk of MI (OR = 2.82, 95{\%} CI: 1.49-5.33) compared with ATTGA haplotype. Furthermore, apoB rs676210 and rs2678379 polymorphisms were significantly associated with plasma levels of apoB in healthy controls (P = 0.01 and 0.02). Our findings indicated that ApoB mutations may be associated with the risk of MI and plasma ApoB levels in healthy controls in Chinese population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the mediator of cortisol, plays a central role in the homeostatic processes. In this study, we addressed the potential impact of HPA axis activity on established anthropometric, metabolic and haemodynamic risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus and stroke. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: A subgroup of 284 men from a population sample of 1040 at the age of 51 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anthropometric measurements included body mass index (BMI, kg m-2), waist/hip circumference ratio (WHR) and abdominal sagittal diameter (D). Overnight fasting values of blood glucose, serum insulin, triglycerides, total, low (LDL) and high density (HDL) lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as resting heart rate and blood pressure, were also determined. By using repeated diurnal salivary cortisol measurements during everyday conditions, methods were developed to characterize the status of the HPA axis, and set in relation to the anthropometric, metabolic and haemodynamic measurements. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, risk factors intercorrelated in clusters of anthropometric (BMI, WHR, D), metabolic (insulin, glucose and their ratio, triglycerides, cholesterol [total and LDL], HDL cholesterol [negative]) and haemodynamic (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate) measurements. This was also the case in the two-dimensional scaling analysis, where, however, HDL separated out. A normal HPA axis status, characterized by high variability and morning cortisol values, as well as a clear response to a standardized lunch and dexamethasone suppression test, was then introduced by a statistical weighting procedure. This did not essentially change the results of either the bivariate correlation matrix or the two-dimensional scaling analysis. A similar introduction of a pathological HPA axis, characterized by low variability and morning cortisol values, a poor lunch-induced cortisol response and a blunted dexamethasone suppression of cortisol, changed the results markedly. Now strong and consistent correlations were found not only within but also between different clusters of risk factors, which also congregated into one distinct cluster, again except for HDL cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: These results disclose the prospect of an overriding function of a pathological HPA axis on other, established risk factors for CVD, type 2 diabetes and stroke. Its close association to HPA axis dysfunction may explain the previously reported powerful risk indication of abdominal obesity for the diseases mentioned. The HPA axis abnormality has been reported to be a characteristic consequence of frequently repeated or chronic environmental stress challenges.},

abstract = {Motivation: There is a growing number of studies generating matched Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 and gene expression data, yet there is a corresponding shortage of statistical tools aimed at their integrative analysis. Such integrative tools are important for the discovery of epigenetically regulated gene modules or molecular pathways, which play key roles in cellular differentiation and disease.Results: Here, we present a novel functional supervised algorithm, called Functional Epigenetic Modules (FEM), for the integrative analysis of Infinium 450k DNA methylation and matched or unmatched gene expression data. The algorithm identifies gene modules of coordinated differential methylation and differential expression in the context of a human interactome. We validate the FEM algorithm on simulated and real data, demonstrating how it successfully retrieves an epigenetically deregulated gene, previously known to drive endometrial cancer development. Importantly, in the same cancer, FEM identified a novel epigenetically deregulated hotspot, directly upstream of the well-known progesterone receptor tumour suppressor pathway. In the context of cellular differentiation, FEM successfully identifies known endothelial cell subtype-specific gene expression markers, as well as a novel gene module whose overexpression in blood endothelial cells is mediated by DNA hypomethylation. The systems-level integrative framework presented here could be used to identify novel key genes or signalling pathways, which drive cellular differentiation or disease through an underlying epigenetic mechanism.Availability and implementation: FEM is freely available as an R-package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/funepimod.Contact: andrew@picb.ac.cnSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

We identify ∼10,000 loops. These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers, correlate with gene activation, and show conservation across cell types and species. Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly ({\textgreater}90{\%}) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs "facing" one another.

Hi-C (high-throughput chromatin conformation capture), a method to detect long-range chromatin interactions, allows extensive genome-wide investigation of 3D chromatin structure. However, broad application of Hi-C data have been hindered by the level of complexity in processing Hi-C data and the large size of raw sequencing data. In order to overcome these limitations, we constructed a database named 3DIV (a 3D-genome Interaction Viewer and database) that provides a list of long-range chromatin interaction partners for the queried locus with genomic and epigenomic annotations. 3DIV is the first of its kind to collect all publicly available human Hi-C data to provide 66 billion uniformly processed raw Hi-C read pairs obtained from 80 different human cell/tissue types. In contrast to other databases, 3DIV uniquely provides normalized chromatin interaction frequencies against genomic distance dependent background signals and a dynamic browsing visualization tool for the listed interactions, which could greatly advance the interpretation of chromatin interactions.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, and ischemic stroke, depends on environmental and genetic factors. To investigate the epigenetic basis of myocardial infarction (MI), we performed an epigenome-wide association study for this condition in elderly Japanese subjects. A total of 192 case subjects with MI and 192 control subjects were recruited from hospital attendees and the general population, respectively. Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles for DNA isolated from whole blood were obtained by analysis with an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The relation of DNAm sites found to be significantly associated with MI to nearby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously shown to be associated with CVD was assessed in the control group. FINDINGS Three DNAm sites (cg06642177, cg07786668, cg17218495) showed genome-wide significant associations with MI (p = 4.33 × 10(-8), 3.96 × 10(-10), and 3.77 × 10(-8), respectively). Two of these sites (cg07786668, cg17218495) still showed such associations after adjustment for classical risk factors of MI (p = 1.04 × 10(-7) and 6.60 × 10(-8), respectively). The DNAm sites cg07786668 and cg17218495 are located in ZFHX3 (zinc finger homeobox 3) and SMARCA4 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4) genes, respectively. SNPs in ZFHX3 or SMARCA4 that were previously found to be associated with CVD were not significantly associated with these DNAm sites in our control subjects. CONCLUSIONS We identified two DNAm sites-cg07786668 in ZFHX3 and cg17218495 in SMARCA4- that are independently and significantly associated with MI. Our results suggest that the development of MI might be influenced by changes in DNAm at these sites via a pathway that differs from that affected by CVD-associated SNPs in these genes. The Kita-Nagoya Genomic Epidemiology (KING) study, which was the source of control samples in the present study, was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00262691) on 6 December 2005.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Diverse molecular alterations associated with smoking in normal and precursor lung cancer cells have been reported, yet their role in lung cancer etiology remains unclear. A prominent example is hypomethylation of the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor repressor (AHRR) locus, which is observed in blood and squamous epithelial cells of smokers, but not in lung cancer. RESULTS Using a novel systems-epigenomics algorithm, called SEPIRA, which leverages the power of a large RNA-sequencing expression compendium to infer regulatory activity from messenger RNA expression or DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles, we infer the landscape of binding activity of lung-specific transcription factors (TFs) in lung carcinogenesis. We show that lung-specific TFs become preferentially inactivated in lung cancer and precursor lung cancer lesions and further demonstrate that these results can be derived using only DNAm data. We identify subsets of TFs which become inactivated in precursor cells. Among these regulatory factors, we identify AHR, the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor which controls a healthy immune response in the lung epithelium and whose repressor, AHRR, has recently been implicated in smoking-mediated lung cancer. In addition, we identify FOXJ1, a TF which promotes growth of airway cilia and effective clearance of the lung airway epithelium from carcinogens. CONCLUSIONS We identify TFs, such as AHR, which become inactivated in the earliest stages of lung cancer and which, unlike AHRR hypomethylation, are also inactivated in lung cancer itself. The novel systems-epigenomics algorithm SEPIRA will be useful to the wider epigenome-wide association study community as a means of inferring regulatory activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data.

Genome-wide surveys of DNA methylation may uncover epigenetic factors influencing lipid metabolism.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS:To identify whether differential methylation of cytosine-(phosphate)-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) correlated with lipid phenotypes, we isolated DNA from CD4+ T cells and quantified the proportion of sample methylation at {\textgreater}450 000 CpGs by using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip in 991 participants of the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network. We modeled the percentage of methylation at individual CpGs as a function of fasting very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs) by using mixed linear regression adjusted for age, sex, study site, cell purity, and family structure. Four CpGs (cg00574958, cg17058475, cg01082498, and cg09737197) in intron 1 of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) were strongly associated with very-low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=1.8×10(-21) to 1.6×10(-8)) and TG (P=1.6×10(-26) to 1.5×10(-9)). Array findings were validated by bisulfite sequencing. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrating that methylation of the top CpG (cg00574958) was correlated with CPT1A expression. The association of cg00574958 with TG and CPT1A expression were replicated in the Framingham Heart Study (P=4.1×10(-14) and 3.1×10(-13), respectively). DNA methylation at CPT1A cg00574958 explained 11.6{\%} and 5.5{\%} of the variation in TG in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:This genome-wide epigenomic study identified CPT1A methylation as strongly and robustly associated with fasting very-low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and TG.

abstract = {The view of atherosclerosis as an inflammatory disease has emerged from observations of immune activation and inflammatory signalling in human atherosclerotic lesions, from the definition of inflammatory biomarkers as independent risk factors for cardiovascular events, and from evidence of low-density lipoprotein-induced immune activation. Studies in animal models of hyperlipidaemia have also supported the beneficial effects of countering inflammation to delay atherosclerosis progression. Specific inflammatory pathways with relevance to human diseases have been identified, and inhibitors of these pathways are either already in use for the treatment of other diseases, or are under development and evaluation. These include 'classic' drugs (such as allopurinol, colchicine, and methotrexate), biologic therapies (for example tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and IL-1 neutralization), as well as targeting of lipid mediators (such as phospholipase inhibitors and antileukotrienes) or intracellular pathways (inhibition of NADPH oxidase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, or phosphodiesterase). The evidence supporting the use of anti-inflammatory therapies for atherosclerosis is mainly based on either observational or small interventional studies evaluating surrogate markers of disease activity. Nevertheless, these data are crucial to understand the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis, and to design randomized controlled studies to evaluate the effect of specific anti-inflammatory strategies on cardiovascular outcomes.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of death worldwide and represent a substantial economic burden on public health care systems. Epigenetic markers have potential as diagnostic markers before clinical symptoms have emerged, and as prognostic markers to inform the choice of clinical intervention. In this study, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for CVDs, to identify disease-specific alterations in DNA methylation. CpG methylation in blood samples from the northern Sweden population health study (NSPHS) (n = 729) was assayed on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Individuals with a history of a CVD were identified in the cohort. It included individuals with hypertension (N = 147), myocardial infarction (MI) (N = 48), stroke (N = 27), thrombosis (N = 22) and cardiac arrhythmia (N = 5). Differential DNA methylation was observed at 211 CpG-sites in individuals with a history of MI (q {\textless}0.05). These sites represent 196 genes, of which 42 have been described in the scientific literature to be related to cardiac function, cardiovascular disease, cardiogenesis and recovery after ischemic injury. We have shown that individuals with a history of MI have a deviating pattern of DNA methylation at many genomic loci of which a large fraction has previously been linked to CVD. Our results highlight genes that might be important in the pathogenesis of MI or in recovery. In addition, the sites pointed out in this study can serve as candidates for further evaluation as potential biomarkers for MI.},

abstract = {The extent to which genetic influences on cardiovascular disease risk are mediated by changes in DNA methylation levels has not been systematically explored. We developed an analytical framework that integrates genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization with epigenome-wide association studies to evaluate the causal relationships between methylation levels and 14 cardiovascular disease traits. We identified ten genetic loci known to influence proximal DNA methylation which were also associated with cardiovascular traits after multiple-testing correction. Bivariate fine mapping provided evidence that the individual variants responsible for the observed effects on cardiovascular traits at the ADCY3 and ADIPOQ loci were potentially mediated through changes in DNA methylation, although we highlight that we are unable to reliably separate causality from horizontal pleiotropy. Estimates of causal effects were replicated with results from large-scale consortia. Genetic variants and CpG sites identified in this study were enriched for histone mark peaks in relevant tissue types and gene promoter regions. Integrating our results with expression quantitative trait loci data, we provide evidence that variation at these regulatory regions is likely to also influence gene expression levels at these loci.},

abstract = {Background and aims The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the association between DNA methylation and coronary heart disease (CHD) or related atherosclerotic traits. Methods A systematic review was designed. The condition of interest was DNA methylation, and the outcome was CHD or other atherosclerosis-related traits. Three DNA methylation approaches were considered: global methylation, candidate-gene, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). A functional analysis was undertaken using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Results In total, 51 articles were included in the analysis: 12 global methylation, 34 candidate-gene and 11 EWAS, with six studies using more than one approach. The results of the global methylation studies were inconsistent. The candidate-gene results were consistent for some genes, suggesting that hypermethylation in ESR$\alpha$, ABCG1 and FOXP3 and hypomethylation in IL-6 were associated with CHD. The EWAS identified 84 genes showing differential methylation associated with CHD in more than one study. The probability of these findings was {\textless}1.37{\textperiodcentered}10−5. One third of these genes have been related to obesity in genome-wide association studies. The functional analysis identified several diseases and functions related to these set of genes: inflammatory, metabolic and cardiovascular disease. Conclusions Global DNA methylation seems to be not associated with CHD. The evidence from candidate-gene studies was limited. The EWAS identified a set of 84 genes highlighting the relevance of obesity, inflammation, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in CHD. This set of genes could be prioritized in future studies assessing the role of DNA methylation in CHD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epigenetic features such as DNA hypomethylation have been associated with conditions related to cardiovascular risk. We evaluated whether lower blood DNA methylation in heavily methylated repetitive sequences predicts the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke. METHODS: We quantified blood DNA methylation of Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element-1 (LINE-1) repetitive elements through PCR-pyrosequencing in 712 elderly individuals from the Boston-area Normative Aging Study. We estimated risk-factor adjusted relative risks (RRs) for ischemic heart disease and stroke at baseline (242 prevalent cases), and during follow-up (44 new cases; median follow-up, 63 months), as well as subsequent mortality from ischemic heart disease (86 deaths; median follow-up, 75 months). RESULTS: Blood LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with baseline ischemic heart disease (RR = 2.1 [95{\%} confidence interval = 1.2-4.0] for lowest vs. highest methylation quartile) and for stroke (2.5 [0.9-7.5]). Among participants free of baseline disease, individuals with methylation below the median also had higher risk of developing ischemic heart disease (4.0 [1.8-8.9]) or stroke (5.7 [0.8-39.5]). In the entire cohort, persons with methylation below the median had higher mortality from ischemic heart disease (3.3 [1.3-8.4]) and stroke (2.8 [0.6-14.3]). Total mortality was also increased (2.0 [1.2-3.3]). These results were confirmed in additional regression models using LINE-1 methylation as a continuous variable. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with prevalent IHD and stroke exhibited lower LINE-1 methylation. In longitudinal analyses, persons with lower LINE-1 methylation were at higher risk for incident ischemic heart disease and stroke, and for total mortality.},

abstract = {Rationale: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Immune functions play a vital role in ACS development, however, whether epigenetic modulation contributes to the regulation of blood immune cells in this disease has not been investigated. Objective: We conducted an epigenome-wide analysis with circulating immune cells to identify differentially methylated genes in ACS. Methods and Results: We examined genome-wide methylation of whole blood in 102 ACS patients and 101 controls using HumanMethylation450 array, and externally replicated significant discoveries in 100 patients and 102 controls. For the replicated loci, we further analyzed their association with ACS in six purified leukocyte subsets, their correlation with the expressions of annotated genes, and their association with cardiovascular traits/risk factors. We found novel and reproducible association of ACS with blood methylation at 47 CpGs (discovery: FDR{\textless}0.005; replication: Bonferroni corrected P{\textless}0.05). The association of these CpGs with ACS was further validated in at least one of the six leukocyte subsets, with predominant contributions from in CD8+T, CD4+T and B cells. Blood methylation of 26 replicated CpGs showed significant correlation with expressions of annotated genes (including IL6R, FASLG and CCL18, P{\textless}5.9×10(-4)), and differential gene expression in case vs. controls corroborated the observed differential methylation. The replicated loci suggested a role in ACS-relevant functions including chemotaxis, coronary thrombosis and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Functional analysis using the top ACS-associated methylation loci in purified T and B cells revealed vital pathways related to atherogenic signaling and adaptive immune response. Furthermore, we observed a significant enrichment of the replicated CpGs associated with smoking and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Penrichment≤1×10(-5)). Conclusions: Our study identified novel blood methylation alterations associated with ACS and provided potential clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our results may suggest that immune signaling and cellular functions might be regulated at an epigenetic level in ACS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiles are responsive to environmental stimuli and metabolic shifts. This makes DNA methylation a potential biomarker of environmental-related and lifestyle-driven diseases of adulthood. Therefore, we investigated if white blood cells' (WBCs) DNA methylation profiles are associated with myocardial infarction (MI) occurrence. Whole-genome DNA methylation was investigated by microarray analysis in 292 MI cases and 292 matched controls from the large prospective Italian European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (EPICOR study). Significant signals (false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P {\textless} 0.05) were replicated by mass spectrometry in 317 MI cases and 262 controls from the Dutch EPIC cohort (EPIC-NL). Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) methylation profiles were also evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: A differentially methylated region (DMR) within the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 12 (ZBTB12) gene body and LINE-1 hypomethylation were identified in EPICOR MI cases and replicated in the EPIC-NL sample (ZBTB12-DMR meta-analysis: effect size ± se = -0.016 ± 0.003, 95 {\%} CI = -0.021;-0.011, P = 7.54 × 10(-10); LINE-1 methylation meta-analysis: effect size ± se = -0.161 ± 0.040, 95 {\%} CI = -0.239;-0.082, P = 6.01 × 10(-5)). Moreover, cases with shorter time to disease had more pronounced ZBTB12-DMR hypomethylation (meta-analysis, men: effect size ± se = -0.0059 ± 0.0017, P TREND = 5.0 × 10(-4); women: effect size ± se = -0.0053 ± 0.0019, P TREND = 6.5 × 10(-3)) and LINE-1 hypomethylation (meta-analysis, men: effect size ± se = -0.0010 ± 0.0003, P TREND = 1.6 × 10(-3); women: effect size ± se = -0.0008 ± 0.0004, P TREND = 0.026) than MI cases with longer time to disease. In the EPIC-NL replication panel, DNA methylation profiles improved case-control discrimination and reclassification when compared with traditional MI risk factors only (net reclassification improvement (95 {\%} CI) between 0.23 (0.02-0.43), P = 0.034, and 0.89 (0.64-1.14), P {\textless} 1 × 10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that specific methylation profiles can be detected in WBCs, in a preclinical condition, several years before the occurrence of MI, providing an independent signature of cardiovascular risk. We showed that prediction accuracy can be improved when DNA methylation is taken into account together with traditional MI risk factors, although further confirmation on a larger sample is warranted. Our findings support the potential use of DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood white cells as promising early biomarkers of MI.},

In a diverse array of diseases and following numerous immune-toxic exposures, leukocyte composition will critically inform the underlying immuno-biology to most chronic medical conditions. Emerging research demonstrates that DNA methylation is responsible for cellular differentiation, and when measured in whole peripheral blood, serves to distinguish cancer cases from controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present a method, similar to regression calibration, for inferring changes in the distribution of white blood cells between different subpopulations (e.g. cases and controls) using DNA methylation signatures, in combination with a previously obtained external validation set consisting of signatures from purified leukocyte samples.

Less is known about the effect of lifetime accumulation and changes of risk factors over time as predictors of CVD mortality, especially in very long follow-up studies.Methods Data from the Finnish cohorts of the Seven Countries Study were used. The baseline examination was in 1959 and seven re-examinations were carried out at approximately 5-year intervals. Cohorts were followed up for mortality until the end of 2011. Time-dependent Cox models with regular time-updated risk factors, time-dependent averages of risk factors and latest changes in risk factors, using smoothing splines to discover nonlinear effects, were used to analyse the predictive effect of risk factors for CVD mortality.Results A model using cumulative risk factors, modelled as the individual-level averages of several risk factor measurements over time, predicted CVD mortality better than a model using the most recent measurement information. This difference seemed to be most prominent for systolic blood pressure. U-shaped effects of the original predictors can be explained by partitioning a risk factor effect between the recent level and the change trajectory. The change in body mass index predicted the risk although body mass index itself did not.Conclusions The lifetime accumulation of risk factors and the observed changes in risk factor levels over time are strong predictors of CVD mortality. It is important to investigate different ways of using the longitudinal risk factor measurements to take full advantage of them.},

abstract = {Many epigenetic association studies have attempted to identify DNA methylation markers in blood that are able to mirror those in target tissues. Although some have suggested potential utility of surrogate epigenetic markers in blood, few studies have collected data to directly compare DNA methylation across tissues from the same individuals. Here, epigenomic data were collected from adipose tissue and blood in 143 subjects using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. The top axis of epigenome-wide variation differentiates adipose tissue from blood, which is confirmed internally using cross-validation and externally with independent data from the two tissues. We identified 1,285 discordant genes and 1,961 concordant genes between blood and adipose tissue. RNA expression data of the two classes of genes show consistent patterns with those observed in DNA methylation. The discordant genes are enriched in biological functions related to immune response, leukocyte activation or differentiation, and blood coagulation. We distinguish the CpG-specific correlation from the within-subject correlation and emphasize that the magnitude of within-subject correlation does not guarantee the utility of surrogate epigenetic markers. The study reinforces the critical role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression and cellular phenotypes across tissues, and highlights the caveats of using methylation markers in blood to mirror the corresponding profile in the target tissue.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that regulates gene expression. Changes in DNA methylation within white blood cells may result from cumulative exposure to environmental metals such as lead. Bone lead, a marker of cumulative exposure, may therefore better predict DNA methylation than does blood lead. OBJECTIVE In this study we compared associations between lead biomarkers and DNA methylation. METHODS We measured global methylation in participants of the Normative Aging Study (all men) who had archived DNA samples. We measured patella and tibia lead levels by K-X-Ray fluorescence and blood lead by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. DNA samples from blood were used to determine global methylation averages within CpG islands of long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1) and Alu retrotransposons. A mixed-effects model using repeated measures of Alu or LINE-1 as the dependent variable and blood/bone lead (tibia or patella in separate models) as the primary exposure marker was fit to the data. RESULTS Overall mean global methylation (+/- SD) was 26.3 +/- 1.0 as measured by Alu and 76.8 +/- 1.9 as measured by LINE-1. In the mixed-effects model, patella lead levels were inversely associated with LINE-1 (beta = -0.25; p {\textless} 0.01) but not Alu (beta = -0.03; p = 0.4). Tibia lead and blood lead did not predict global methylation for either Alu or LINE-1. CONCLUSION Patella lead levels predicted reduced global DNA methylation within LINE-1 elements. The association between lead exposure and LINE-1 DNA methylation may have implications for the mechanisms of action of lead on health outcomes, and also suggests that changes in DNA methylation may represent a biomarker of past lead exposure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cells can be primed by external stimuli to obtain a long-term epigenetic memory. We hypothesize that long-term exposure to elevated blood lipids can prime circulating immune cells through changes in DNA methylation, a process that may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. To interrogate the causal relationship between triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and genome-wide DNA methylation while excluding confounding and pleiotropy, we perform a stepwise Mendelian randomization analysis in whole blood of 3296 individuals. RESULTS This analysis shows that differential methylation is the consequence of inter-individual variation in blood lipid levels and not vice versa. Specifically, we observe an effect of triglycerides on DNA methylation at three CpGs, of LDL cholesterol at one CpG, and of HDL cholesterol at two CpGs using multivariable Mendelian randomization. Using RNA-seq data available for a large subset of individuals (N = 2044), DNA methylation of these six CpGs is associated with the expression of CPT1A and SREBF1 (for triglycerides), DHCR24 (for LDL cholesterol) and ABCG1 (for HDL cholesterol), which are all key regulators of lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS Our analysis suggests a role for epigenetic priming in end-product feedback control of lipid metabolism and highlights Mendelian randomization as an effective tool to infer causal relationships in integrative genomics data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in the regulation of interindividual lipid level variability and thus may contribute to the cardiovascular risk profile. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genome-wide DNA methylation and blood lipid levels high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Observed DNA methylation changes were also further analyzed to examine their relationship with previous hospitalized myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were determined in whole blood samples of 1776 subjects of the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg F4 cohort using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). Ten novel lipid-related CpG sites annotated to various genes including ABCG1, MIR33B/SREBF1, and TNIP1 were identified. CpG cg06500161, located in ABCG1, was associated in opposite directions with both high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ($\beta$ coefficient=-0.049; P=8.26E-17) and triglyceride levels ($\beta$=0.070; P=1.21E-27). Eight associations were confirmed by replication in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg F3 study (n=499) and in the Invecchiare in Chianti, Aging in the Chianti Area study (n=472). Associations between triglyceride levels and SREBF1 and ABCG1 were also found in adipose tissue of the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource cohort (n=634). Expression analysis revealed an association between ABCG1 methylation and lipid levels that might be partly mediated by ABCG1 expression. DNA methylation of ABCG1 might also play a role in previous hospitalized myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.15; 95{\%} confidence interval=1.06-1.25). CONCLUSIONS Epigenetic modifications of the newly identified loci might regulate disturbed blood lipid levels and thus contribute to the development of complex lipid-related diseases.},

abstract = {Postprandial lipemia (PPL), the increased plasma triglyceride (TG) concentration after consuming a high-fat meal, is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual responses to a meal high in fat vary greatly, depending on genetic and lifestyle factors. However, only a few loci have been associated with TG-PPL response. Heritable epigenomic changes may be significant contributors to the unexplained inter-individual PPL variability. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on 979 subjects with DNA methylation measured from CD4+ T cells, who were challenged with a high-fat meal as a part of the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network study. Eight methylation sites, encompassing five genes, LPP, CPT1A, APOA5, SREBF1, and ABCG1, were significantly associated with PPL response at an epigenome-wide level (P{\textless}1.1x10-7), but no methylation site reached epigenome-wide significance after adjusting for baseline TG levels. Higher methylation at LPP, APOA5, SREBF1, and ABCG1, and lower CPT1A methylation each was correlated with an increased TG-PPL response. These PPL-associated methylation sites, also correlated with fasting TG, account for a substantially greater amount of phenotypic variance (14.9{\%}) in PPL and fasting TG (16.3{\%}) when compared to the genetic contribution of loci identified by our previous genome-wide association study (4.5{\%}). In summary, the epigenome is a large contributor to the variation in PPL, and this has potential to be used to modulate PPL and reduce CVD.},

abstract = {Motivation: The Illumina Infinium 450 k DNA Methylation Beadchip is a prime candidate technology for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely differ-ent DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs. Results: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normal-ization strategy for 450 k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a stat-istical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favour-ably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes. BMIQ will be useful as a preprocessing step for any study using the Illumina Infinium 450 k platform.},

So, create mixture model of beta distributions separately for Type I and II consisting of un-, hemi-, and methylated components, using the distribution parameters from the Type I probes to adjust beta values from Type II, while allowing the mixture weights to vary to allow for differences in frequency of U/H/M between probe types.},

abstract = {Epigenetics is emerging as an attractive mechanism to explain the persistent genomic embedding of early-life experiences. Tightly linked to chromatin, which packages DNA into chromosomes, epigenetic marks primarily serve to regulate the activity of genes. DNA methylation is the most accessible and characterized component of the many chromatin marks that constitute the epigenome, making it an ideal target for epigenetic studies in human populations. Here, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from a community-based cohort stratified for early-life socioeconomic status, we measured DNA methylation in the promoter regions of more than 14,000 human genes. Using this approach, we broadly assessed and characterized epigenetic variation, identified some of the factors that sculpt the epigenome, and determined its functional relation to gene expression. We found that the leukocyte composition of peripheral blood covaried with patterns of DNA methylation at many sites, as did demographic factors, such as sex, age, and ethnicity. Furthermore, psychosocial factors, such as perceived stress, and cortisol output were associated with DNA methylation, as was early-life socioeconomic status. Interestingly, we determined that DNA methylation was strongly correlated to the ex vivo inflammatory response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to stimulation with microbial products that engage Toll-like receptors. In contrast, our work found limited effects of DNA methylation marks on the expression of associated genes across individuals, suggesting a more complex relationship than anticipated.},

Although chronological age has been linked to changes in DNA methylation, the methylome has not yet been used to measure and compare human aging rates. Here, we build a quantitative model of aging using measurements at more than 450,000 CpG markers from the whole blood of 656 human individuals, aged 19 to 101. This model measures the rate at which an individual's methylome ages, which we show is impacted by gender and genetic variants. We also show that differences in aging rates help explain epigenetic drift and are reflected in the transcriptome. Moreover, we show how our aging model is upheld in other human tissues and reveals an advanced aging rate in tumor tissue. Our model highlights specific components of the aging process and provides a quantitative readout for studying the role of methylation in age-related disease. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is not yet known whether DNA methylation levels can be used to accurately predict age across a broad spectrum of human tissues and cell types, nor whether the resulting age prediction is a biologically meaningful measure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: I developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types. The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock can be used to address a host of questions in developmental biology, cancer and aging research.},

Although the mechanisms linking adiposity to associated clinical conditions are poorly understood, recent studies suggest that adiposity may influence DNA methylation 3–6 , a key regulator of gene expression and molecular phenotype 7 . Here we use epigenome-wide association to show that body mass index (BMI; a key measure of adiposity) is associated with widespread changes in DNA methylation (187 genetic loci with P {\textless} 1 × 10 −7 , range P = 9.2 × 10 −8 to 6.0 × 10 −46 ; n = 10,261 samples). Genetic association analyses demonstrate that the alterations in DNA methylation are predominantly the consequence of adiposity, rather than the cause. We find that methylation loci are enriched for functional genomic features in multiple tissues (P {\textless} 0.05), and show that sentinel methylation markers identify gene expression signatures at 38 loci (P {\textless} 9.0 × 10 −6 , range P = 5.5 × 10 −6 to 6.1 × 10 −35 , n = 1,785 samples). The methylation loci identify genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, substrate transport and inflammatory pathways. Finally, we show that the disturbances in DNA methylation predict future development of type 2 diabetes (relative risk per 1 standard deviation increase in methylation risk score: 2.3 (2.07–2.56); P = 1.1 × 10 −54},

abstract = {Background: The influence of genetic variation on complex diseases is potentially mediated through a range of highly dynamic epigenetic processes exhibiting temporal variation during development and later life. Here we present a catalogue of the genetic influences on DNA methylation (methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL)) at five different life stages in human blood: children at birth, childhood, adolescence and their mothers during pregnancy and middle age. Results: We show that genetic effects on methylation are highly stable across the life course and that developmental change in the genetic contribution to variation in methylation occurs primarily through increases in environmental or stochastic effects. Though we map a large proportion of the cis-acting genetic variation, a much larger component of genetic effects influencing methylation are acting in trans. However, only 7 {\%} of discovered mQTL are trans-effects, suggesting that the trans component is highly polygenic. Finally, we estimate the contribution of mQTL to variation in complex traits and infer that methylation may have a causal role consistent with an infinitesimal model in which many methylation sites each have a small influence, amounting to a large overall contribution. Conclusions: DNA methylation contains a significant heritable component that remains consistent across the lifespan. Our results suggest that the genetic component of methylation may have a causal role in complex traits. The database of mQTL presented here provide a rich resource for those interested in investigating the role of methylation in disease.},

abstract = {Aging associates with impaired pancreatic islet function and increased type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 26-74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in $\beta$-cells alter insulin secretion. Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.},
